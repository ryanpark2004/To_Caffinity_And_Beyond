It’s incredible to have and beyond convenient! Read more | 5.0\nAddicting!  Smooth, fresh taste.  Part of my monthly subscribe and save now.  It is a great way to enjoy iced coffee without the caffeine. Read more | 5.0\nI really enjoy this Wandering Bear decaf cold brew. It’s extra strong, smooth, and unsweetened, it's one of the best-tasting cold brews I’ve found. It’s also super convenient to keep in the fridge since it’s shelf-stable and ready to pour over ice whenever I want. My only gripe is the price—definitely on the expensive side for a regular purchase. I’d also love it if they offered this in individual cans for easier portability, and a half-caff version would be a game changer. Great quality, just wish it came with more options and a lower price! Read more | 4.0\nYou can taste the pumpkin spice! Has a slight slight bitterness, I’m assuming it’s not the actual coffee but maybe the nutmeg of pumpkin spice. The coffee itself is sooooo good! I put some pumpkin pie sauce, and syrup in the coffee and topped it with pumpkin spice cold foam And OMG it was so good! I’m going to order a couple more boxes before they sell out for the winter so I can have it for the next couple months!! I’ve tried a popular concentrated coffee brand J0t and their pumpkin spice was sooo bitter and gross couldn’t drink it. I feel like now I can have an upgraded Starbucks at home 🤗 especially since it’s discounted right now $27 per box because it’s end of season! I’m stocking up!! Read more | 5.0\nI don’t typically like to write negative reviews for products that have the potential to be good, however, in this case, I believe it’s best to do considering the price of this particular cold brew product. So, with that stated above, I will continue to explain my review in the following words: My son and I enjoy drinking all types of various coffees from americanos, cold brews, and well...you know, just plain old coffee! So my son and I wanted to try another cold brew out and decided upon this product. We were both pleasantly surprised how easy it was to set up in the fridge, and with a quick turn of the spout...yes, cold brew came pouring out! It was amazing how simple and easy we can have some cold brew! But, to our shock and dismay, the first swig didn’t go down so well. Unfortunately, as we took a nice swig of cold brew from this amazing container, we looked at one another as if we had seen a ghost. A look strikingly similar to that look you make when your lips purse and you feel like vomiting. This cold brew tasted like something was off with it; it’s very sour and just tasted absolutely awful! So awful, that neither one of us could even take another sip without gagging. For a cold brew that sells for nearly $30 dollars and looks quite presentable, you’d expect it to taste good. I think this company needs to improve the taste of its cold brew so that it can lead to more satisfied customers because the idea and concept of it is great, but the quality in the product itself is clearly lacking. Read more | 3.0\nThis ice coffee tastes great and is so convenient!!!! Read more | 5.0\nEDIT 07/29/22 I should have wrote this edit sooner, as the company contacted me 2 days after posting my review. They were very apologetic that my husband and I didn't *love* the cold brew and without hesitation, gave us a full refund of our money. I mean wow! What amazing customer service. The fact that they went above and beyond like this is amazing, I feel very few companies have this great of customer service. I hope no one takes advantage of the company this way, but I really hope that someone reads this and at least tries their cold brew. It may not be *for my taste*, but there are obviously a lot of 5 star reviews that say other people obviously really like their cold brew. Honestly, I was so excited to get this in. Cold brew on tap? I mean seriously, who wouldn't love that? With that being said, unfortunately, it didn't meet expectations. This thing is FORTY DOLLARS. I mean, that's A LOT of money for coffee. Yes it's on tap, but honestly when received the package, both my husband and I said \"that's it?\" Also, this coffee is fairly bitter. So bitter, it's got like that sour after taste. Not sure if ice is supposed to kinda offset the bitterness when it melts, but it's almost undrinkable to be honest, even after dousing it with creamer to try to help the bitterness. The convenience is there, but I definitely won't be ordering this again unfortunately. FORTY DOLLARS. Sorry, had to re-state that, so much money :( Read more | 5.0\nWe love the coffee but our shipment of three boxes arrives damaged every month.  Typically I can duct-tape the dispenser box together and make it useable.  However, my December shipment was not only damaged dispenser boxes but one unit was spoiled -absolutely undrinkable.  It was sour and emitted an odor.  I cancelled my subscription but I am still out the cost of one unit as it is not able to be returned.  This coffee is a very good product and it is expensive.  But there is no way for me to receive a refund for the spoiled unit or to ask for more careful packing of the product.  (More often than not the 3 boxes are loaded into one shipping box, along with other small items. The small items are smashed as well.)

Having only had an hour of sleep Before having to leave the house today I came back drank that little bit of coffee and it made me sleep about six hours, which is wonderful! And it tasted good too so I think this might be my new coffee which is weird to say because I am a tea drinker not a coffee drinker. I like the fact that I did not have to add milk because I’m out of all of my different types of milk us. Coffee taste bitter to me. That’s why I added a touch of sugar  Literally a half of a cube, but it did what I needed it to do, which is fall asleep. So thank you!

    "reviews": "Salted Caramel Espresso + Light Cream Espresso + Cream The packaging is sleek and modern, reflecting Starbucks' branding. Small and easy to carry, they are perfect for on-the-go consumption. The design includes essential information about the product, including the type of espresso, ingredients, and nutritional facts. The pull-tab makes it easy to open, and the can itself is recyclable, aligning with Starbucks' sustainability efforts. One of the biggest points of Starbucks espresso shots is convenience. Ready to drink. The primary ingredients include brewed Starbucks espresso, water, and natural flavors. Some variations may include sugar or sweeteners to balance the bitterness of the espresso. Each typically contains around 150 mg of caffeine, equivalent to a standard double shot of espresso. The calorie count is relatively low, making it a guilt-free option for those watching their intake. Priced higher than typical canned coffee beverages, Starbucks espresso shots justify the cost with premium positioning and quality. While it may not be the most economical choice for daily consumption, it offers good value for those who prioritize taste, convenience, and brand reliability.

Read more | 5.0\nOne out of the twelve was bad in taste but, the rest were fine.  Product arrived undamaged and on time.  My rating has to do with that one bad can and not delivery. Read more | 4.0\nAfter years of trying various versions of this small, canned Doubleshot, I’m staying with the Light version for a number of reasons: 1. Consistent flavor. Try ordering an Iced Shaken Espresso (formerly known as a Doubleshot) at more than one Starbucks, and you’ll get two different-tasting drinks. 2. Consistent texture. Even versus other flavor variations in this line of canned coffees, the Light is the only one without lumpiness or particles settled at the bottom. 3. Price. At the time of this writing, each can is about $1.65-1.70, versus $5-6 at a Starbucks. Sometimes I think that “I worked hard, I deserve someone to make me a $5 coffee…” but I don’t feel that way if I know I have a better coffee waiting for me in my fridge for a fraction of the price! 4. Great on the go. When I need to vaporize cobwebs in my head fast, or to stay awake for a long stretch of driving or working, this is very dependable. Highly recommended for all these reasons. I hope it helps you, too! Read more | 5.0\nThis is my favorite canned coffee. Taste great, nice and strong flavor. Plenty of caffeine and has a smooth texture.

Bad tour guides.. Flavor is ok, taste a little of the dark caramel compared to mocha there is no mocha flavor but more like ginseng and guarana. The white chocolate has a more neutral flavor and the white chocolate flavor is barely there but ok. I still prefer the mocha even though I don’t taste the mocha. Back on the caramel flavor, I set it up for subscribe and save. And just today they jacked the price of $45 and change. Caramel version is in no way anywhere near worth that price and if the other flavors get price jacked as well then I will retaliate and switch over to monster or even victor allens. Caned caffein.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Sweet Cream Sweet Cream Dark Cocoa Sweet Cream 2 Flavor Variety Pack Black Unsweetened I had never tried this before so I decided on a whim to add it to my cart. It’s delicious. It’s pricey though. I would honestly recommend sticking with the less costly coffee that you love. This was good for something different & to have as a treat, though! Read more | 5.0\nThis is the greatest substitute for coffee in the morning.  When I got off coffee, I tried a lot of things and this made the grade. Read more | 5.0\nI will be the first to admit, these things taste great but are simply too expensive. I continue to drink them because I am hooked, and I really enjoy the convenience of being able to grab a quick nitro cold brew as I head out to work, but if they get much more expensive I just won't be able to justify it anymore. I will say that I have tried many other canned brands, and as far as nitro goes, I still prefer Starbucks over the others, which is odd as I am not at all a Starbucks fan. For those who drink the nitro cold brews served at Starbucks stores, these do not taste the same and generally will not have as good of a foamy head (at least not straight from the can). There are tons of tips on how to create the best drinking experience for these, and I am sure the other reviews will do it more justice than I can, so please make sure to check those as well. Read more | 5.0\nReally good. Just wish it was not as expensive. Still cheaper than going to a brick and mortar though! Read more | 4.0\nI wish these weren’t so pricey or I would order and drink them every single day! The nitro makes the coffee so smooth and creamy. You really don’t need much coffee creamer. I am in love with these drinks!! Read more | 5.0\nGreat for grab and go in the morning and the flavor is better than ordinary black coffee. If you let it sit for over an hour the flavor starts to flatten out so drink it while it’s freshly opened! Read more | 5.0\nThis is a tasty coffee which I like to enjoy when I need a little caffeine boost. While I enjoy the taste and convenience of this product there are a couple of drawbacks which are quite severe. First, these cans are pretty small, being a little less than 10 oz. Most soda cans are 12 oz. This doesn't seem like a big difference but I can sip on a soda for half and hour and be finished with a can of this in under 10 minutes. Obviously this beverage isn't carbonated but it is still unfortunate to have so little to drink. Second, as some others have mentioned, is the price. These cans individually are between $4-6 each depending on the current Amazon price. For this price I could purchase a large size coffee at the coffee shop for less money which would be similarly caffeinating and satisfying. So while I enjoy this product, it is a small serving for a high price. It is good quality and tastes nice but you are really paying for convenience here. Read more | 3.0\nI been going to Starbucks for this drink for a few years and enjoying it. When I found these I was very happy.

LOVE IT Read more | 5.0\nIt's too sweet and tastes nothing like real pumpkin; it has a very synthetic flavor. My  favorite Super Coffee latte flavors are vanilla and mocha; they're both pretty tasty, though you don't taste the coffee as much as you do w/brewed coffee. 'Pros': I like this brand because it has zero sugar and doesn't give me a 'caffeine high'. I can drink it late at night and it doesn't affect my sleep. It has a high potassium content, which is  nice, because my potassium intake isn't what it should be. A big 'con' is the packaging. The bottles are very hard to open and the company uses more plastic than needed. It sometimes take a sharp knife (w/a risk of cutting yourself) to break through the packaging to get the lid off. The packaging has recently changed a bit - at least for some flavors. The inner, hard-to-peel-off foil seal is gone, which is nice, but the bottle itself is still hard to open w/the pull-tab provided. And if you're a recycler, you have to peel the plastic label off the bottle before recycling. Also - the price is a lot higher than it should be, though it varies depending on flavors you choose and whether the company is running a sale. I buy it because I like it, but the pricing is outrageous sometimes. Read more | 3.0\nSon lo que esperaba y me han hecho mucho bien | 5.0",

Several flavors are available, but I like this one. I might switch to a different option. Read more | 5.0\nGreat taste, right amount of caffeine. A lot cheaper than Starbucks. Read more | 5.0\nThe first time I received this in the mail, every single can was damaged. It looked like each of them had been physically thrown or dropped. Large dents on every single can. I don't know what the process is with packaging, it it's because of Amazon's horrible job packing the boxes or if it actually happened at the manufacture's warehouse? I received it in a large 15lb box with 2 other items, the empty space in the box was barely filled. However, I was pleasantly surprised to have zero push back about immediately replacing the damaged product. Within 5 days I received a new case. Still horribly packaged with another item that had been damaged because of that previous order having barely any padding in the box. I was pretty annoyed opening the box to see zero padding in this one with the same fragile item as before. LUCKILY neither product was delivered damaged this time. That aside, in my personal opinion, this tastes great if you don't mind a \"flat\" bitter taste. If you are looking for Espresso, that's exactly what you will get. And the energy source that comes with it. Again, for me personally, it doesn't hit like a hyper energy drink, it wakes me up and gives me a feeling of \"coffee on the go\". I think it's a great replacement for both energy drinks and coffee! This is coming from someone who used to drink 1-2 energy drinks daily. So aside from the delivery shenanigans... I love it!

Any time I’ve tried other canned coffee brands I find myself taking a sip, disliking the flavor and throwing it out… It is the perfect balance of between sweet and bitter plus only 50 calories a can & it is a double shot of caffeine :) Read more | 5.0\nBased on the reviews I decided to give these a try. I definitely understand everyone has different taste and likes coffee a certain way. However, not knowing what they(other viewer's) liked or a comparison to what they liked made it difficult to know if I would like these or not. So I'm going to try and explain my preference and if you like what I like then you DEFINITELY won't like these! My normal coffee is Nescafe Clasico/ Dark roast(love that it's frothy, creamy, & doesn't leave that bitter after taste) with Coffee mate Snickers creamer and no sugar because the creamer is enough. I also love Biggby's frozen Butter bear latte w/ extra sweetener and no whip topping. I love my coffee strong but I love the flavors of sweeteners as well. I'm not a black cup of coffee or a 5 teaspoons of sugar person like my two sisters. I guess I'm in the middle. That being said I bought a few different brands to try because my local stores never had my creamer in stock. It would be sold out for weeks and my mornings were just blah without my coffee on the way to work and my first break. We like what we like for our morning regimen lol This does NOT taste like cappuccino! I found this almost tasteless! Really watered down coffee that may have been an extremely light roast, not frothy like some have said, and definitely not creamy either. It was like using one of those k-cups that you fill with your own coffee except you didn't put fresh grounds in it for the third time so it has a faint taste of watered coffee. Which is how my best friend likes her coffee. If you shake some of these (even lightly) you'll get sprayed and it didn't change the taste for me. I really hope this helps someone out.

    "reviews": "This is the first time ordering this brand, I’m not I have ever seen or heard of the company. As for canned coffee, this has truly opened my eyes, and my mouth. I can honestly say, I’ve only ordered the Café au lait thus far, it is BY FAR the best flavor. I have a walking disability so our kitchen being downstairs, I hate having to ask family or visiting friends for coffee…canned coffee is what I’ve turned to ordering. I actually favor my coffee cold, for the most part of my life, I can recall being a toddler and my aunts/grandparents pouring their hot coffee into a high ridged plate so I could wait for it to cool off cause I would pester them for their coffee haha. 40yrs later I’m still consuming my coffee cold (room temp, or chilled in my small fridge. Wow. I don’t believe I have ever “commented” highly praising something I’ve purchased from Amazon. But WOW this has truly moved me to do so!!! Could be the caffeine content hahahaha but my fingers and my brian just had to sing Boss’ praises! Read more | 5.0\nBy far my favorite iced coffee. The flavor is excellent. They are more expensive than other brands but I feel the quality is worth it. Read more | 5.0\nHad this when I was in Japan. I love it. Read more | 5.0\nThe richness of the coffee is the best. It is literally a perfect blend. Though I think it’s pretty expensive for a pack of 12 but it must be imported because I could not find these in any stores near me. I’m just glad Amazon has them! You’ll feel like a BOSS with this, I got asked so many times by fellow associates on what I was drinking. I’ll keep on buying these whenever I run out! Read more | 5.0\nBOSS Cafe Au Lait is a wonderful chilled coffee, with just the right amount of everything. This isn't as sweet as most of your syrupy drive through or gas station iced coffees, but it isn't particularly \"strong\" enough to discourage people who like flavor with their coffee. It's a really good blend of both. It's creamy, its sweet enough to take some of the bitterness of a strong-ish coffee away, but has an unchalleneged coffee counterpunch to still remind you that what you have is a coffee, and not a dessert. I tried both the Cafe Au Lait and the Vanilla, and though both were good (and will get equal ratings from me), I definitely find myself preferring the Cafe Au Lait. Not sure if it's because I prefer the flavor, or just have a bias knowing it is their \"signature\" flavor. Either way, really solid product. I believe they have changed the packaging since some of the prior reviews. I saw a review or two complain about bad packaging and crushed cans, I experienced none of that! The coffee came in little square, thick cardboard boxes. Each can nestled in it's very own little carboard compartment inside of the box. The cans themselves are extremely thick. This isn't your crush with a flick of the wrist cola can, it is a solid piece of metal (and also a bit deceiving as the weight of the can makes you think you still have coffee left even when your done!). These are definitely recyclable, and out of the 2 boxes I order I only has 1 or 2 cans with very minor denting. Very, very minor. I actually liked the boxes so much with the little compartments, I kept them for the garage so when I am working on my car(s), I can drop certain items in the compartments to keep them organized or safe. My lone gripe is one that is subjective, so it may not even be entirely fair for me to take a star off, but I do think the price is high for what it is. The cans are not huge, and break out to over $2 a piece. I think a more reasonable price would be between $1.75 - $2 a can, especially since you essentially have to buy in \"bulk\". But I get it is an imported novelty product that has some mark-up. Overall I am happy with my purchase and plan to buy more in the future. Read more | 4.0\nWhen I went to Japan in January, I had boss coffee from one of the many vending machines and loved it so much that I wanted more in the US. I have shared this with all of my friends and family and they love it too! Read more | 5.0\nI've been wanting to try some Japanese canned coffee for a while, and I heard good things about Boss Coffee. I bought a case of the Au Lait flavor and loved it! It tastes like freshly-brewed coffee; it has a strong coffee flavor, with a mild sweetness to balance it out. It's the perfect way to start the day, and makes a good pick-me-up throughout the day as well. Boss Coffee is among the best canned/bottled coffee I've had, I'll definitely order more in the future. Read more | 5.0\nI love BOSS coffee. Used to buy it in bulk from a local Japanese grocery store. They stopped selling the Japanese black cans and replaced them with these. They’re roughly the same price but I get more of them at a time on Amazon. The Café au lait is a very sweet, but I’m okay with it. It’s unfortunate that it costs so much, since I practically live off of the stuff. I recommend this coffee to people all the time, but they’re all very hesitant to try it because of the high price point. Over all, it’s great coffee, but if you enjoy it as much as I do, you might end up spending way more on this than you would on other coffee. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "Vanilla Mocha Caramel I tried a bunch of different canned coffees between Amazon's and Walmart (all with milk and sweetened with assorted flavors) and this brand was the winner. I did find some others that I liked perhaps a shade better (Colombe I think) but the price difference made no sense to me. These are a really good flavor and much better value than other brands. Also doesn't leave me with any chemical tastes that I've noticed from some other brands. I personally use canned coffee as a \"backup\" on mornings that I am running late and don't have time to brew coffee, or to keep in my office for days indeed some extra caffeine without spending $6 on a Starbucks. I like this canned coffee better than any of the instant packets I have tried, and it's still shelf stable! Even if you don't refrigerate it ahead of time, pouring it over some ice is easy Read more | 5.0\nHave bought several times Read more | 5.0\nI like the smooth coffee flavor, but dislike the (what seems to me) the intense sweetness. I wish there was a little less sugar. Read more | 4.0\nI was pleasantly surprised when I tried this coffee.

Read more | 5.0\nMultiple cans had an unappealing chunk of something inside. I thought bugs had been getting into my drinks (spit into the trash without searching for the culprit) until my last can. This last one I had covered and well supervised so nothing could get in. When I spit it out on a plate this time, it was a white chunk I assume of curdled product (no legs or anything). Still better than swallowing a fly but really ruins the experience of the drink. Read more | 1.0\nvery good taste like a thin vanilla milk shake but way too sweet.  It you like sweet, this is your best choice in lattes.  I did not have ANY chunks or chewy pieces at all in my entire case of drinks so maybe they fixed that problem.  this does not have much coffee flavor tastes more like a milkshake.  doesn't mean you won't like it just know it's REALLY sweet!!

I found these on Amazon Tues. 5/28 and ordered 2 cartons of 12 each...They are as good as I remember. They are 8oz cans and I usually drink 2 at a time. I put three in my freezer 2 hrs ago and just opened one now. And loving it...They do have a sweet taste but  not overly sweet in my opinion. But I drink regular coffee sweet. They probably won't taste very good to someone who drinks Starbucks. But your not paying Starkbucks price either.

They are my go-to now that Kona is gone. I buy here so I don't have to get the little 4 pack tiny cans they now sell in stores (really...3 oz less each can!) Problem is, Amazon, your packing is terrible!! Usually the cans are intact and all that's wrong is torn plastic surrounding them. The past 6 months they come open and rolling around in the box. The last one (Jan 8, 2025) had 4 cans with leaks in them I couldn't even find, everything was sticky and soaked because they ship ALL 6 of my subscriptions in a single box, and the box and tape are now so flimsy and thin the box itself is always 40%+ open. In the past, a couple boxes were returned to Amazon, credited to my account as \"undeliverable due to damage\", and I have to reorder them! Really Amazon?? We pay what, $140 a year for Prime and you can't spare some packing materials and a decent package?! I suggest having them shipped separately due to this - when I've ordered them alone they come in a great box, packed well.

    "reviews": "Winter Mint Chocolate Vanilla Strawberries & Cream Root Beer Float Pumpkin Spice Peaches & Cream Mint Chocolate Cookies & Cream Cookie Dough Cinnamon Roll Chocolate Peanut Butter Chocolate Caramel Cake Batter Banana Cafe Latte To begin  I  will say why these shakes are so important to me; I have 2 Idiopathic digestive system disorders  Gastricparerisis and Gastricstenosis. For unknown reasons they developed weeks after I had my Gallbladder removed at 19. (It means eating solid food became unpleasant even with Boxtox injections in my valve every 18months)  I was told by my gastro specialist to use Protein shakes to prolong my time before having a feeding tube placed.  Finding one when you have severe allergies is not easy.  I have tried a ton it feels like and had many bad experiences. I even used foods meant for babies. When first diagnosed. In 2019-20 I discovered Premier Protein Shakes they were a game changer for me because they have no soy and use sunflower oil. So I can drink them without taking benadryl first.  There are only 2 flavors I must avoid Chocolate Peanut butter and Cafe Latte do to the Legume and Caffeine content. I don't feel salty about this because they make so many other great flavors. I have tried every flavor I could and will say a little bit at the end for each one. By far though my favorite is Cake Batter Delight. When life hands me a lemon I have a Cake Batter Delight. When I first started using these shakes I was on two anti-nausea meds and was really struggling. I couldn't even drink a whole bottle in 24 hours.  I am now on 1 nausea med as needed.  I can on a low digestion day (no solid food)  drink 2.  Usually though I drink one for my dinner and have slider (semi solid or ground food ) during the day. Now please don't misunderstand I  am not claiming they cured me.  What they have done was bring me out of a state of malnutrition as my doctors and dietician explained. So I feel better and can do normal things and not live in a hospital or a foot from a bathroom.  I still have all my conditions.  The feeding tube as I age is still probable. Those with chronic illness will understand the Spoon theory.  Primer Protein allows me to have more spoons available which, means a improved quality of life. Cake Batter 5\\5 my dessert choice Caramel 5\\5  like it alone or in decaf coffee or hot chocolate. Vanilla 5\\5 like to use a bit on cereal too. Strawberries and Cream 5\\5 no weird after taste like ensure &Boost Chocolate Winter Mint 5\\5  tastes just like Andes Mints Cookies and creme 5\\5 tastes like a Oreo Cinnamon Roll 3.5\\5 Too Sweet for me to drink as a shake has to be in decaf coffee. Pumpkin Spice 2\\5 Has the scent but flavor is weak Chocolate 1\\5  brown water no chocolate taste added Nestle Nesquick Banana Cream 0\\5 reminds me of Banana flavored medication for kids. Chalky. Now  I have had some cons with this product. Heat and cold seems to clump it up. So on the east coast I see the Premier \"worms\" (they aren't parasites I showed a doctor)like  people mention twice a year. It's separation of the protein blend from the water and oil. So I strain my shakes before drinking. On a few occasions I have experienced receiving  spoiled shakes shipped to me or purchased locally do to a defect in the sealing process I was told. The retailers quickly resolved the issue.  It's only happened Once here on Amazon and it was quickly resolved. The new clear bottle and red cap design seems to have ended the spoilage issue as it was the white bottle and cap with paper cap that was a problem in my experince. Much of the time I can find it fairly priced there have been some times I saw it and thought is it April 1st? Overall a awesome product I would give my highest recommendation . Read more | 5.0\nI drink these shakes every morning!  They are not chalky or globby.  Just give them a little shake and they are a smooth and refreshing start to your day.  These keep me full and I get a nice dose of vitamins as well as 30 grams of protein in each one with only 160 calories.  I drink the Cafe Latte flavor and my husband drinks chocolate.  I also have an older friend with health issues that is drinking these daily to get their vitamins and nutrients without having to eat a full meal. These are great for on the go nutrition that is good for you and tastes great too! Read more | 5.0\n[BEFORE SHAKING clean any \"slime\" from inside the neck and cap. Then check bottom for dense residue to determine if it needs to be strained.*] [UPDATE: Costs.  03/17/25 I agree these are too expensive. My cost when I started 2+ yrs ago was $23/12, now it is $30/12. I have noticed varying prices and tried to change my subscription to one less costly. (Didn't work, dang it.) But I did discover the paper containers are cheaper. I changed my order again. I  opted for one that said $23+/-... it ended being $25. But that's a $5/12 saving. And I drink 2 to 3 a day. I just received my first order. Will update as necessary.] I am an elderly woman who is suffering from kidney and heart issues. I don't have much appetite, so also losing muscle like crazy. I am looking like all those other wrinkly, skinny old people I said I wouldn't. So my doctor said high protein shakes. Okay. I started researching. Because of price and ratings I started with a couple 4-pks of Premier from a local grocery outlet. Cafe latte... Yum! Then I went to Amazon to get regular deliveries because I no longer drive. Read lots of reviews. I noticed some mentions of outlets besides Amazon. I also noticed a link to 'Premier Store'. Given the bad reviews re slime and expiration dates, I carefully made sure I wasn't ordering through an outside source. Don't  know if that actually helped, but I have had very few of those issues in the past 2+ years. **Although, to make sure on the slime, I open a bottle before shaking and check inside the neck and cap, to wipe out if needed. Then re-cap and shake, shake, shake. One could also pour through a fine/tea strainer.** Besides Cafe Latte, I have tasted Peaches and Cream, Vanilla, and Strawberries and Cream. None of these are strong flavored, but I can taste the chocolate and coffee in my favorite. The Vanilla is refreshing, as is the Peaches and Cream (which has a delicate peach flavor). The Strawberries and Cream is cooling and not untasty, just not much flavor. And I have added Bananas and Cream, which is also nice but mild. One more issue: digestion.  Some people's innards don't like the soy and/or the lactose. Others are more forgiving. I get some bloat but the benefit I receive outweighs any mild discomfort. Just because some people can't tolerate this product doesn't mean it's bad. My last note...lead. Lead is bad. But I have been around lead for many decades, from leaded gasoline polluting roadside blackberries (oh, no!) to lead in paint for all kinds of things. It hasn't had much impact on me (that I know of) and I am not giving these to anyone else, so, in the meantime, whatever life I have left will not be spent worrying about it.  Granted, you younger people and children do need to be cautious. Ain't it fun? UPDATE:  23 Oct 2023 1.  To start, the shakes I get are shipped in thick, heavy-duty boxes in which the bottles are closely and firmly packed and the company name and other pertinent info is printed on the outside. If yours isn't it is likely from an outside vendor, with issues such as expiry dates and improper storage, not to mention higher prices. 2.  Regarding the slime and stomach issues, they appear to be caused by the same \"problem\"--- the protein. While some flavors have two types of condensed (is that the word I want?) milk proteins combined, some also have soy. The proteins sometimes separate a bit causing the slime.  My suggestion above still holds. And, I'm sorry to say, the stomach issues are also caused by the milk proteins and lactose. Over 60% of Americans suffer from some level of lactose intolerance (not allergy); an individual's level of intolerance will determine how bad you feel. Jeeze! Finally, recycling the bottles: Rinse and zip off the cover which is discarded. Done. BUT if you live in either Oregon (me) or Maine you have the option to redeem the bottles for 10 cents or 5 cents, respectively, if the portion of the cover stating so is still attached. Granted it's not a lot, but it builds.  The choice is yours.  I am drinking 2-3 daily, so I am donating my $$ to our residential park's CERT program to buy disaster supplies. [Oregon is in the middle of the Cascadia Subduction Zone --northern CA to Vancouver Island BC-- inevitable massive (9 +/-) earthquake. When, not if.] Now I'm done! Have a healthy life. Read more | 5.0\nI love these. They taste great and are very easy. I like to take one to drink on my ride to work. I arrive with more energy as well has proper nutrients to help me during my day, that I might otherwise be missing out on. That being said, I can barely afford these at 1 a day. I have to take tolerance breaks just to afford them. I wish there was a cheaper alternative that taste as good. I tried the powdered form of this and it taste like a wet gym sock so a figure that has to be them manipulating the market because they make so much more money off the bottles.

Read more | 5.0\nLa Colombe Triple Latte is my favorite cold coffee. It's good and balanced... not too much sugar but just the right sweetened coffee and no artificial sweetener. Having noted that it remains my favorite, recently I thought I detected a bit of a change. It's slightly too much like chocolate milk and less like strong triple coffee. Now, when the can is opened there is less nitro -fizz and the product is just flatter than it used to be. I've noticed consumer comments online about how the product has changed. La Colombe's varieties used to be packaged in 9 ounce cans with a unique plastic lip guard. The lip guards were color coded according to each different variety of coffee. The lip guard was specific to the La Colombe brand and made for a one-of-a-kind sensual consumption experience. Well, no more. La Colombe switched to a lip-guardless (and cheaper I'm sure) can from the can manufacturer Ball. I wish they would bring back the old style cans! So, it's changed and not what it once was. The price varies and it now can be found \"on sale\" at times. It's still my favorite, but... dare I say \"Make It Great Again\"? Read more | 4.0\nThe unheralded new recipe is a travesty. Did they think we wouldn't notice???? I've been drinking one of these a day for the past 7 or so years. I LOVED the original product. I have had it on Subscribe and Save here on Amazon for years, plus I buy it when it's on sale at Target and other supermarkets. It was THE BEST canned mocha drink and I've tried them all. It was somewhat similar to the iced mochas at actual La Colombe cafes - those are very bitter cocoa, unsweetened with a strong espresso flavor. The canned national versions were of course sweeter but the main flavor was of coffee and bittersweet dark cocoa - NOT sugar. It was subtly sweet and totally unique in the world of canned coffee drinks. There was a reason I spent well more than $1000 per year on La Colombe mocha cans, and cracking open a cold one first thing in the morning was an important and joyful part of each of my days. No more. The new flavor tastes like so many cheap knockoffs I've tried - it primarily tastes like a Yoo-hoo or a bottle of NesQuik. I can't taste the coffee and can barely taste the cocoa. All I taste is sugar. I couldn't finish the first can I tasted; that will be my last. It's truly disgusting and unbefitting of the La Colombe brand. It tastes like a \"Great Value\" brand drink or something you'd buy at BIG LOTS. So I have just cancelled my Subscribe and Save -- and it's hard to express how truly saddened I am to lose a product that was so important to me. I'm going to stop frequenting the cafes and buying the whole bean La Colombe products as well. This is a massive loss. There should be a rule on Amazon that if a product changes so drastically -- especially its taste -- you are notified and have a chance to opt out of the subscriptions. It is a total deception they didn't put the words \"NEW RECIPE\" on the package, and a crime to basically lie to their fans and customers by omitting that. For shame. Read more | 1.0\nTastes amazing.

From personal experience: do not drink if you are dehydrated, the shakes are so much worse. that said, flavor wise they're quite nice and miss out on the chemical taste a lot of canned coffees seem to have that hit in the back of the throat. I have never had issue of these arriving expired, but if you live in warmer climates it may be possible they go bad. They do contain some milk products.

Read more | 5.0\nI've become a real fan of Atkins Mocha Latte Iced Coffee Protein Shake. Each carton has 15g of protein, is low glycemic, has 4g net carb, and only 1g of sugar. These taste amazing, give me a little boost, and they really have been a great source of protein for me. I've been healing from a leg wound and my physical therapist recommended these for me - I've found they've been a valuable part of my healing journey. This is a 12-pack. I drink one a day and am absolutely happy with them. I'd say this is probably my favorite of all the Atkins flavors. I like that they included some caffeine for a nice little boost along with the protein. The flavor is great and not overpowering. These don't have a powdery taste like some protein drinks and I love the smoothness. These are easily my favorite protein shakes and the quality has been consistent as I've ordered these several times. I'm quite happy! Read more | 5.0\nThese Atkins drinks are so convenient and are great for a meal replacement or snack. They taste great and they smell so good. I really love the flavor. The price was a great value price on Amazon for a lot of three packs. I have been eating a low carb diet. I will continue to purchase these Atkins drinks as I really do like them. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the Atkins Mocha Latte Iced Coffee Protein Shake, and it exceeded my expectations in several ways. As a coffee lover and someone who values a convenient source of protein, this drink is now a regular part of my routine. Flavor (5/5): The Mocha Latte flavor is fantastic. It's rich and indulgent with a perfect balance of coffee and chocolate. It's like having a coffee shop treat, but with added benefits. The flavor is spot on, and I love that it's not overly sweet, allowing the coffee taste to shine through. Protein Boost (4/5): With 15 grams of protein per bottle, this shake is a great way to supplement your protein intake. Whether you're on a low-carb diet or just looking for a convenient post-workout protein source, this fits the bill. It helps keep me full and energized. Convenience (5/5): The ready-to-drink format is incredibly convenient. I can grab a bottle on my way out the door in the morning or toss it in my gym bag. It's a time-saver, and I appreciate that it doesn't require refrigeration until after opening. Low Sugar (5/5): One of the main reasons I choose Atkins products is their commitment to low sugar content. With only 1 gram of sugar, I don't have to worry about a sugar crash or compromising my low-carb diet. Satisfaction (5/5): This shake has quickly become my go-to pick-me-up during the day. It satisfies my coffee cravings while providing a good dose of protein. I've even used it as a base for my morning smoothies, and it works wonderfully. In conclusion, the Atkins Mocha Latte Iced Coffee Protein Shake is a delicious and energizing option for anyone who loves coffee and wants to up their protein intake. The flavor is top-notch, it's convenient, and the low sugar content is a huge plus. It's become a staple in my daily routine, and I highly recommend it to others looking for a tasty, protein-packed beverage. Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n4.0\n5.0\n5.0",

    "reviews": "Vanilla Latte Sweet Cream Latte Mocha French Vanilla Dark Chocolate Core Variety Pack Chocolate Variety Pack Chocolate Caramel Energy Variety Pack I hardly ever write a review so for me to take my time and do this, YOU KNOW YOU GOT TO READ!!!! A body builder I trust to get health advice from recommended these premade shakes because of their high quality ingredients and no artificial sweeteners. She said they were creamy and good. As I look on Amazon I thought “man! These are expensive” but I CANNOT find a protein that isn’t so sweet, taste wired, or has artificial sweetener. So, I decided to try it! Y’all! WORTH EVERY PENNY! These suckers taste so good and not too sweet! I literally got them today, pulled out the dark chocolate, poured it over ice and was instantly HAPPY!!! Protein is something you need to invest in and this is it! I will buy these from now on! You got to try this!!! Read more | 5.0\nI've been drinking Slate drinks for two months now and they are worth getting if you are looking for High Protein drinks with natural sweeteners. I started off with the classic variety pack and if you are expecting these to taste like chocolate milk or milk in general, you are best sticking with Core Powers (which I also like but have more calories and sugar/sugar alternatives). None of these drinks are very sweet but both the chocolate and dark chocolate taste good. I'm not a fan of the vanilla which is very bland but it's fine if you eat something along with it. I'd highly recommend the chocolate variety which has the mocha flavor and is the sweetest and best tasting, however it has caffeine which may not be what everyone is looking for in a protein drink. Due to the not liking the vanilla, I haven't tried the coffee variety pack because it has a vanilla latte but I think I'll give it a go for my next order because of how much I like the mocha flavor. If so, I will update this accordingly. I've seen these at some grocery stores so if you are on the fence about buying a 12 pack, I'd recommend getting one of the chocolates or mocha and then ordering a case on here to save money. Read more | 5.0\nI really wanted to like this healthy protein drink, especially since it looked so much like chocolate milk in the advertisements. The idea of enjoying a delicious chocolate milk-like beverage while getting a good dose of protein was very appealing to me. I was extremely excited to try it, but unfortunately, it somewhat disappointed me in a few aspects. Firstly, the drink’s texture and taste didn’t quite meet my expectations. While it wasn’t bad, it lacked the rich, thick taste that one would expect from something that looks like chocolate milk. The flavor was somewhat weak and didn’t have the indulgent, creamy consistency that I was hoping for. I found myself wishing it had a more robust chocolate taste to better mimic the experience of drinking actual chocolate milk. Additionally, I would advise potential buyers to take a close look at the nutrition label before making a purchase. While it’s marketed as a healthy protein drink, the nutritional content might not be as diet-friendly for everyone as it appears. Depending on your specific dietary needs and restrictions, you might find that it doesn’t fit as well into your diet as you’d hoped. For instance, it might contain more sugar or calories than you’d expect from a protein drink. Overall, it’s not a bad product. It has its merits, especially if you’re looking for a convenient way to boost your protein intake. However, it could be improved by having a richer, thicker style of taste that better aligns with the chocolate milk image it promotes. While it didn’t quite hit the mark for me, it might still be a good option for those who are less particular about the texture and taste, and more focused on the nutritional benefits. Read more | 4.0\nSlate is such a convenient way to get your protein with low sugar and it still tastes. Amazing! Great for busy lives! Delicious !! Read more | 5.0\nPerfect product for people who like to eat only protein for breakfast. Wakes me up and nourishes my body. Also very tasty. Read more | 5.0\nI bought Slate Milk protein shakes because I liked that they were packaged in easy to recycle aluminum cans, rather than plastic bottles. The ultra-filtered milk is easy to digest, but unlike Fairlife shakes, Slate only uses monkfruit as a sweetener. I don't care for it, as I find it has an unpleasant aftertaste. The dark chocolate flavor was the least offensive to me, I struggled to finish the vanilla and milk chocolate flavors because of the bitter after taste. If you don't mind monkfruit as a sweetener, you'll probably love them, I just couldn't get past it. Read more | 3.0\nDelicious 100 calorie protein drink. Great as a quick meal or a supplemental snack during the day. Read more | 5.0\nI'm happy with the amount of protein and low calories provided by this shake.  However, the taste isn't that great.  The monk fruit sweetener leaves an unpleasant aftertaste.  So far, the dark chocolate is the better tasting of the three. Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "Peppermint Mocha Mocha Latte Vanilla Latte I recently tried the Quest Iced Coffees, and they have quickly become my go-to beverage. These iced coffees are delicious and perfectly crafted to meet my caffeine needs. **Taste:** The taste is phenomenal. Each flavor I tried was rich and satisfying, with just the right balance of coffee and sweetness. The creamy texture makes it feel indulgent, yet it’s a guilt-free treat thanks to its low sugar content. **Nutrition:** As someone who is health-conscious, I appreciate the nutritional profile of these iced coffees. They are low in sugar and carbs, making them a perfect choice for those on a keto diet or anyone looking to reduce their sugar intake. The added protein is a bonus, making it a great post-workout drink as well. **Convenience:** These iced coffees are incredibly convenient. They come in ready-to-drink bottles that are perfect for on-the-go lifestyles. Whether I’m rushing to work, heading to the gym, or just need a quick pick-me-up, these coffees are ready when I am. **Variety:** The variety of flavors is impressive. Each one is distinct and delicious, offering something for every coffee lover. From classic mocha to vanilla, there’s a flavor to suit every mood and craving. **Quality:** The quality is consistent across all the bottles I’ve tried. The coffee is smooth and never bitter, which speaks to the high standards Quest maintains. In conclusion, Quest Iced Coffees are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a delicious, nutritious, and convenient iced coffee. They offer great taste, excellent nutritional value, and the convenience of a ready-to-drink format. Highly recommend giving them a try! Read more | 5.0\nThis is a low carb, almost no sugar, protein added coffee drink. It doesn't taste like regular bottled iced coffees that are full of sugar. That said, if you are accustomed to artificial sweeteners, protein drinks, and \"diet\" food these are great. Creamy and sweet but you can still taste the coffee. I am hooked on the Peppermint Mocha but I'll be trying other flavors when the seasonal flavor sells out. Read more | 5.0\nNo idea how they keep cranking out all of these awesome products. The macros on them are on point and they somehow still taste amazing. This coffee drink is sweet like Starbucks but you can’t tell that it’s supposed to be a healthy protein drink. Highly recommend and will be buying again! Read more | 5.0\nI just had my first Quest ice coffee drink cafe latte and am SO PLEASED to have found this special drink because of : 1. The nutritional value 2. Tasty 3. The low sugar content 4. I need the added calories 5. Convenience This drink doesn’t exactly meet my coffee tastes because I always drink decaffeinated drinks and like my coffee dark as this is a little too milky for me.  But I can always fix that with added coffee & some ice cubes. I want to add that the sweetness level is just a little too sweet for me but adding ice cubes or additional coffee can solve that. I did try one other coffee drink, the Splenda cafe latte and was amazed in a bad way at how sweet it was; just undrinkable for me because of that. All in all, I’m happy to say that this is now my go to drink in the morning! Read more | 4.0\nLove these protein drinks, I have one every morning with a higher protein drink, since these only have 10 grams of protein.  Love the caffeine. Read more | 5.0\nITS EXPENSIVE BUT IT IS SO GOOD Read more | 5.0\nI gave both mocha & vanilla a try but I'm only leaving one review. A little back story on me that pretains to my review. I don't like sugar free stuff or in this case almost sugar free. I've tried stuff with I think every sugar substitute & id rather not have it at all if sugar free is the only option except in the most dire of situations. With that said, I was surprised at the flavor of these, taste pretty good. I am always looking for convenient, cost effective iced coffee drinks, so I thought I'd give these a try. These have the bonus of having protein without tasting like protein powder & a few other nutrients. If you want a partial meal replacement or an appetite suppressor, these do seem to curb it. Now, it could be just me & I don't know what it is, but these leave me with a weird taste in my mouth or maybe more like a weird feeling after drinking. It may be just me with some sort of allergic response to something in it. I'm not sure if it may be sucralose, like I said I don't consume much sugar replacement stuff, so I'm not sure if I have a physical response to it or it's the dairy or forms of dairy that's in it or something else. I do have a little sensitivity to some dairy or some forms of dairy sometimes. It's kind of a prickly, itchy feeling with kinda an undescribable subtle taste. It also gives me dry mouth, which I have some problems with anyways but these exasperates b& even sinuses that can't be quenched with water & It remains for half the day. So to sum up, they taste pretty good while drinking, they have some positive benefits for appetite control & nutrients & the caffeine but the after effects for me leads to me saying pass & I won't be purchasing anymore. Others may have different experience, this is just mine. Read more | 3.0\nThis is the best ice coffee. I have ever had great texture and great taste. Definitely. would recommend. Read more | 5.0",

Definitely worth keeping in the fridge! Read more | 5.0\nIf they had sent the Signature Black I know I would have enjoyed it as I have ordered it is the past. What I have received is Madagascar Vanilla. Not what I ordered. So I ordered again and still received Madagascar Vanilla.

It tastes great and is easy to use/make. It comes in a size that is easy to store.

The suggested water to concentrate ratio isn’t bad but you may want to adjust based on your preferences.

Im able to use my own syrup with this to make my iced coffee at home which ultimately saves me money, so I’m very satisfied Read more | 4.0\nI've not much to say about this one... My son loves it It is his favorite! He likes having it at home for days when he doesn't want to run to Starbucks.

Mocha is my fav flavor too. I am happy with the speed in which i receive the order from Amazon. Super coffee is great and has clean ingredients. Love the 12 oz bottle size; it is not too much and perfect for a quick pick me up coffee drink. I believe they used to be a bit stronger but are now a little less caffeine, not sure I might be wrong. They are still very good. Love the flavor overall...oh and great if you freeze into ice cube trays , makes a shake like coffee in the blender!

This used to be a fantastic drink but everytime i buy it over the past year it comes expired. Don't buy.

LOVE IT Read more | 5.0\nIt's too sweet and tastes nothing like real pumpkin; it has a very synthetic flavor. My  favorite Super Coffee latte flavors are vanilla and mocha; they're both pretty tasty, though you don't taste the coffee as much as you do w/brewed coffee. 'Pros': I like this brand because it has zero sugar and doesn't give me a 'caffeine high'. I can drink it late at night and it doesn't affect my sleep. It has a high potassium content, which is  nice, because my potassium intake isn't what it should be. A big 'con' is the packaging. The bottles are very hard to open and the company uses more plastic than needed. It sometimes take a sharp knife (w/a risk of cutting yourself) to break through the packaging to get the lid off. The packaging has recently changed a bit - at least for some flavors. The inner, hard-to-peel-off foil seal is gone, which is nice, but the bottle itself is still hard to open w/the pull-tab provided. And if you're a recycler, you have to peel the plastic label off the bottle before recycling. Also - the price is a lot higher than it should be, though it varies depending on flavors you choose and whether the company is running a sale. I buy it because I like it, but the pricing is outrageous sometimes. Read more | 3.0\n1.0\nSon lo que esperaba y me han hecho mucho bien | 5.0",

    "reviews": "I ordered these Loco Coffee Black Cold Brew Coffee 11 Ounce Can, 12 Count | Dark Roast, 190mg Caffeine for my husband to drink in the morning... and HE LOVES IT!!! Let me preface this by saying, I am not a coffee drinker. Once in a blue moon I will order some frilly drive through drink, but I'm not a coffee gal for the most part. In addition to having a great taste and being very convenient to pop open, there are quite a few things my husband and I like about this Loco Cold Brew: •MADE WITH HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS •DELICIOUS WHEN ENJOYED COLD •VERY STRONG •GIVES YOU A HEALTHY DOZE OF ZOOM •CAN BE DOCTORED UP WITH PROTEIN, CREAMERS, SYRUPS, ETC. Both my husband and I don't enjoy very strong coffee, so we open a can and either split it between us by making it go further with creamer and ice, or he uses it for two drinks. When you take into account that we get 24 drinks out of this pack, I think it is a great value for the money.... especially considering what we would have spent at a chain coffee shop!!! BEWARE: This stuff really packs a punch as far as the caffeine goes, so make sure to not overdo it and crash! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!!! Read more | 5.0\nIt's okay, it's not my favorite option though. It tastes how it's described- like very strong coffee. My problem with it was it wasn't really any smoother or more refreshing than any other type of coffee. I'm not sure whether I would recommend this product or not, there's nothing wrong with it, and you might love it if you love strong coffee, but it wasn't smooth enough for me. Read more | 4.0\nTo start; if you've never tried canned coffee, these taste great. They've got a very rich, almost chocolatey flavor. They're brewed to be pretty strong, but don't taste bitter at all. Having a set of grab-and-go cold brew cans in the fridge is very convenient. The caffeine content is a little higher than a standard cup of coffee (190 mg) so if you're caffeine sensitive this might be a bad fit for you. The only ingredients are coffee, water, and natural flavor; I like that there aren't any preservatives or strange chemicals. Relative to their cost, they're an OK value. They're more expensive than home brewed coffee, but if you go out for your daily cold brew, they'll definitely save you money. All in all, I really like these cans. There's a lot of coffee per can (12oz pint glass pictured with the coffee from one can), and the flavor is great. All in all, I would strongly recommend these! Read more | 5.0\nOkay. So. This does not taste the best on its own, coming from someone who likes black coffee. It really needs some additions to make it palatable. But! With the additions (like a touch of cream), then it's very good. Kind of like iced coffee stock lol. So, not bad, overall, but for the intended purpose of a quick drink to take with you on the go? Not for me. Read more | 3.0\nThis is a decent cold brew overall. The can is nicely made and feels sturdy in the hand. The coffee is decent tasting. Not the best tasting cold brew that I've ever had but it's not bad. The caffeine is nice and strong with an equivalent of two cups of coffees worth of caffeine. This is a great option for coffee for me especially when I'm in a rush and have to run out the door. There have been several times where I didn't have time to make coffee before I left and this thing came in clutch. I'm wondering if there is anything to do to improve the flavor because it would make this product that much better. I'm pretty happy overall with it and I'd recommend it to anyone who is looking to try some cold brew options. This seems like a pretty good product and a pretty cool company as well. Read more | 4.0\nWhat makes cold brew different from regular coffee is the smoothness, and this one is the real deal. It is super smooth with right amount of boldness, but without harshness, and it tasted even better when I tried it over iced milk with a tiny pump of caramel. Of course, I always prefer straight black cold brew that’s properly chilled, so this one from Loco made it to my favorite list. The unit price of $2.50 isn’t too bad these days, but I wish it were under $2. Read more | 5.0\nThis high in caffeine content, unsweetened coffee surprisingly tastes smooth and not at all bitter. It is really convenient when you are too lazy or rushed for time to brew your own. It is made up of just 2 ingredients, coffee and water, which is appealing to me, but it does not offer as much value as other similar 11oz coffee brands. Read more | 4.0\nTasty as-is out of the can or over ice with creamer. Nice flavor, no funky aftertaste. Convenient and yummy. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "I only do esspresso shots with a little bit of sweetness like adding condensed milk. Sometimes some soy but minimal like a traditional macchiato. I like my coffee on a more smooth, sweet taste and this hits the spot. I found this thru a subscription, and was happy finding this on here to buy. 2lbs seems like a lot but it’s worth it if you enjoy this coffee. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the Bark at the Moon dark roast coffee whole beans and was looking forward to as they describe - The rich flavors of dark chocolate and caramel drizzle coupled with a caramel-like aftertaste. This blend is the outdoor lover's dark roast. It captures the spirit of adventure with the fresh taste of the wild keeping you barking until the moon rises. Unfortunately, I can't do a review on that blend because I'm pretty sure that I received the other blend called Hell Yeah, medium roast beans. (See pictures of Front labels) Besides not tasting like the Bark at the Moon description, or looking like dark roast, the labels on the front of the bag represent the Hell Yeah blend. However, the label on the back indicates the Bark at the Moon blend (See picture). So, I will go ahead and review the Hell Yeah - medium roast that the product description states that it Tastes Like Swiss Chocolate, Macadamia Nut, Sweet, since I'm pretty sure that's what I got. Opening the bag for the first time, I got a good whiff of some nice smelling beans. Grinding them produced more pleasing smells. The first taste after brewing presented a nutty, smooth, full flavor taste. Didn't really detect a Swiss Chocolate flavor, although there were some undertones of another flavor but DEFINITELY NOT Dark Chocolate or Caramel as what was supposed to be in the coffee I ordered. It was VERY good tasting coffee, just not what I ordered. Will I order this again? Probably not, and as much as I would've LOVED to get the Bark at the Moon, I probably won't take a chance trying to order again and hope I get it the next time. Read more | 4.0\nIt smells so good when you grind it  and has a chocolate smell mixed with the smell of really good coffee. And it is really good. It's the kind of coffee that when you start drinking it like you normally would, maybe two or three good sips then set it down for a minute, you keep drinking it instead. before you know it there is none left in the cup. That's pretty much how it happened for me, and yeah it's really good coffee. But it's also 40 dollars which cost it a star. Read more | 5.0\nThe ultimate example of how much I enjoyed Drink Coffee Do Stuff's Bark at the Moon blend was two weeks ago when I had to wake up at 5am to be ready to register my daughter for pre-school next year...the program we are using opens their online registration very early and you want to be first in line to get everything submitted/completed as that can have some impact on if your kid gets into the program. This is usually not a pleasant experience as it entails typing endless pages of contact information, medical details and academic goals...but....I actually looked forward to rolling out of bed because I knew I had a pot of Bark at the Moon ready to go! The bag I got said it was roasted on 2/15 and I received several days after that...so this is some of the freshest coffee I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I thought that was really cool. I'm a fan of darker blends of coffee and Bark at the Moon certainly fits that category. The description professes it to have notes of dark chocolate, Carmel drizzle and be very rich...I for sure agree with the last two..the dark chocolate doesn't really come out for me that I can notice. I have actually also tried the \"Hell Yeah\" blend from this same company and you can very much taste a difference between the medium-ness of that and the darkness of the Bark at the Moon. The packaging the beans came in seemed high quality and let me rubber band it back up in between grinding beans. I use a Bodum burr grinder and the beans come out really nicely ground up/fine for my drip coffee maker (Technavorm Mochamaster). This morning I have a busy day so I ground up enough for two pots. Pictured are my cats inspecting the bag and my first cup of the morning. Great product! Read more | 5.0\nI think I can taste a bit of the chocolate notes. This coffee is very light, and I'm not a huge fan of dark roast but I'm glad I got dark roast. The beans are not oily at all and smell great. The first thing I noticed was that it was acidic and sour black. So I had it with my usual milk and honey and it just lacked the other notes and depth I'm used to. I do sense the sweetness of the coffee, I think it's not as bitter as I'd imagine dark roast to be. Great mild coffee, good with milk Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "Oatmilk Vanilla Oatmilk Double I am able to drink the milk draft lattes, but I wanted to try the oat milk because these were available in a pack of 4. They are better than most other oat milk beverages I’ve tried. A smooth creamy texture with minimal sugar. I still prefer the milk version but if you can’t drink milk these are a good choice. One thing I appreciated is that the 9oz oat milk latte has 120mg caffeine and the milk draft latte only has 100mg caffeine. I find 120mg to be the perfect amount for me and I felt more energized after drinking the oat milk latte compared to the usual draft latte I drink when I have to get up early. (The Triple draft latte, which is 150mg in a 9oz can, is slightly too much for me to drink too often.) Read more | 5.0\nGreat flavor!

For canned oat milk lattes, go for Rise, Sang, or Chamberlain's. Rise is also nitro-infused and has a much better flavor. Sang's Saigon Cinnamon is delicious. Chamberlain's oat milk mocha tastes great and is also a much better value than these.

    "reviews": "Hazelnut Iced Latte Caramel Iced Latte Vanilla Iced Latte Love this drink. Read more | 5.0\nI saw a lot of reviewers upset it was not an iced latte from several years ago. Cool. I never had that one so I have nothing to compare it to. But this product had me buying Maxwell House, a brand I have not even considered buying in years. The vanilla was eh, but the caramel and hazelnut were very tasty and looked very fancy. Stir properly is my only tip and add ice last like the instructions say. I have enjoyed them with syrups and over a base of regular coffee. I may or may not have enjoyed these with adult beverages. At under 120 calories, it is 1/3rd of my Cafe shop latte in calories and 1/3rd the cost. Plus I don't have to deal with the 30 caffiene deprived people lined up in front of me as I do there. That is a win. Read more | 5.0\nI read the other reviews and they were positive on the whole.  The one thing I read, which I ended up doing was to mix the powder with a little bit of hot water at first and then add more cold water.  Instead of having cold water, I used cold brew coffee I had in my fridge, which makes it extra tasty.  This does not taste like a caramel latte from the coffee shop, but has enough sweetness and flavor to do the trick while you are home. Read more | 4.0\nLove this so much!

    "reviews": "Wild Berry Variety Pack Ocean Citrus Alpine Mint TL;DR: Delicious energy boost without the guilt of sugar, preservatives, or artifical ingredients. We tried Machu Picchu energy drink (variety pack w/ Alpine Mint + Ocean Citrus) at the recommendation of one of our friends, who highly recommended it. Now we know why! The flavor is crisp, clean, and refreshing. You can taste the yerba mate (reminds me of sipping the original in the mountains of Peru) and the lightly flavored citrius or mint flavor. It's really easy to drink and not overpowering (unlike a lot of other energy drinks that I've dried). My favorite so far is Ocean Citrus. The energy I get from Machu Picchu is really smooth - not overpowering like coffee (which I can't have much of without getting jittery) but more like tea or a fresh bowl of acai. Finally, love that the company is giving back to communities in LatAm and the US. Really love knowing that my $s are going to good causes including helping communities in Peru, Brazil, and the US. Overall, would highly recommend Machu Picchu - it's now my go to energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nJust cracked open my first Alpine Mint Machi Picchu Yerba Mate, and it was surprisingly refreshing; nice green tea/ coffee flavor with a light cooling mint finish, no nasty aftertaste.  I subbed my regular morning coffee with the Machu Picchu, and I am ready to tackle my day.  Can I run a marathon?  No.  But, this is a nice beverage to have morning, mid day, or evening, when you need just a bit of energy to finish your task.  I would buy this again, maybe next time in the Citrus flavor, to give it a try as well.  Oh, I like that this drink has caffeine as the energy boost and not all those sugars and amino acids that other brands have. Read more | 5.0\nI bought this based on reviews and my taste buds must be alot different from the people that like this. I couldn't even finish one it tasted so bad. I wish I could return it but maybe I can find someone local that might buy the rest to recoup some of the $34 so it's not a total loss. Definitely going back to the Guayakí! Read more | 1.0\nThis is a good brand but pricey for what you get. Still I do enjoy this brand. Read more | 4.0\nTo me it tastes like a black tea with a hint of citrus. Love the fact that it’s sugar free and has a mid amount of caffeine for that lunch time boost. No jitters for me Read more | 5.0\nFirst time trying this new flavor of Machu PIcchu's Yerba Mate and it's now my favorite! Love the citrus flavor and that it's made with clean, organic ingredients. It's light, has only a small hint of sweetness & a solid level of natural caffeine that doesn't leave me feeling jittery like other brands. I also back their do-good mission of helping underserved children. Love the product & feel good about supporting this small business. Can't wait for new flavors! Read more | 5.0\nI was really looking forward to trying this product, but the flavors just didn't hit the mark for me. The aftertaste was strong and off-putting, making it hard to enjoy. I couldn't even finish one can because of it. Unfortunately, I won’t be purchasing this again. Read more | 3.0\nI recently ordered a case of this product and could not be more happy. Recently I have been studying for a big exam in my life and have been switching between various energy drink brands to try to find the right one. Machu Picchu has been the perfect energy drink for me. Unlike other brands, Machu Picchu does not give me that jittery cracked out feeling that can often get in the way of performing my best. Furthermore, I do not experience the typical energy crash from drinking Machu Picchu that I do from drinking other brands. Not to mention, the flavors are amazing. I love this flavor and the ginger peach flavor. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "Variety Snickerdoodle Peppermint Mocha These were tasty Read more | 5.0\nIf you are someone who likes Pop & Bottle, this package is much more worth than buying a singular bottle from Amazon or other grocers. I don't really like canned coffees, so to me this tasted like slightly salted coffee that was also very sweet, but for someone who does like sweet canned coffee, I think this would be a good option. It is a limited holiday edition and does indeed taste like snickerdoodle, so if you like snickerdoodle and want a holiday coffee, I would recommend. Personally though, it is not my favorite canned coffee. Read more | 4.0\nDelicious! I love all the pop and bottle products but this one is my favorite!

Read more | 5.0\nI decided to try this drink because it is advertised as all natural, and I'm a sucker for anything peppermint during the winter holidays. I don't usually like sweet drinks, so this one is a little much for me. The chocolate was the strongest flavor, with just a hint of mint. I love mint, and would love if this drink was MORE minty! I may try another can but dilute it with some almond milk, and maybe add some additional mint extract or schnapps. I'm also planning to try it warmed to see if I like that better. Overall, it's a festive and fun drink for the holiday season. Read more | 4.0\nTaste is amazing! Value is better than stopping at a coffee shop! Read more | 5.0",

My last subscription with the rainforest has been split into arrived early and arriving late. I no longer have anymore subscriptions with the rainforest and am reducing the rainforest to  source for when no other means available. Membership fee is a waste when all it provides is mishandled products, expired products misdelivered products and crushed products. The rain forest is only gotten worse with no more hope in sight. Update//// 11-8-24 Have had to change to the double shot because the triple shot comes with a little bit of clumps in it. The minim clumps is most likely the milk content coagulating do to exposure to heat during stocking shipping or delivery shipping. Haven’t had the same issue with the double shot cans. Prefer the taste of the triple shot but the lumpy texture is annoying. Product tastes so good I drink 2 a day.

It is easy to prepare, just mix with some hot water and stir it up. I like the quality and this comes in a variety of flavors so I just want to keep trying more.

    "reviews": "Triple Shot Vanilla Bean Triple Shot Espresso Triple Shot Black Love the coffee and taste. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been drinking my coffee black since high school so I know what good coffee taste like. And these are good quality coffee. Read more | 5.0\nEspresso Triple Shot by High Brew is my go-to for a super boost.  225 caffeine. I never drank hot coffee. EVER. Not one cup. It all tastes burned.  I discovered cold brew after I retired.  High Brew's 8 oz Double Shot Espresso is my \"go-to\" accelerant to buy.  140 caffeine. But when I need 2-4 more hours out of a single can, this Triple Shot Espresso does the long term job for me.  225 caffeine. I do find that the Double Shot can will coagulate, but I do give them a bit of a upside down shake before I store them upside down. Then we put them in the refrigerator right side up, to be consumed in the next 2-3 days.  There can still be a bit of sludge in the bottom. Of course, do not open immediately after a shaking. Without any shaking, the Triple Shot seems to have less than 25% of the coagulation and sludge that the Double Shot has.  Neither bothers me, it lurks at the very bottom of the can, I know it's there and this works great for my pep. I do make my own cold brew, but for times when drinking from a can and not having that burnt taste, this is  the only brand for my taste buds.  I did not like the \"Black\",  and the \"Vanilla Bean\" is ok once in a while, but too sweet.  Any non-cold brew I have tasted has been poured out.  Yuck.  Even SB cold brew - poured out.  Same with most cold brew cans - poured out. To get a trial run?  Watch for sales.  Look for singles in stores.  Or buy a case and offer them as a tasting, at a gathering.

Read more | 5.0\nI have typically enjoyed ordering these to grab each morning on my way to work, but my most recent order has milk chunks in each can. It's gross. Previously there has been some amount of solids because of settling, and shaking the can gets rid of it... However... this time it's definitely the milk that's gone off. For the amount I paid this time, this is not the quality I expect and probably won't order these this way ever again. Read more | 3.0\nRating is due to price gouging, not the product. I've seen this go over $60 for a 12 pack here. it's a joke. Buy Black Rifle coffee for less than $20 a case. It's literally just as good and 200mg caffeine.

It is ok, it just isn't the preferred flavor profile I am looking for. Thought I would let others know that you are not crazy if you experience the same thing. Read more | 4.0\nI used to make my own cold brew, but when my dispenser broke, I decided to just switch to concentrates. I also got tired of dealing with all the grinds, so I wanted something premade or concentrated. I tried a couple of different cold brews available on Amazon, including the concentrate offered by Java house, in addition to several other brands’. Even when I made the cold brew according to the recommended ratio, the coffee was either watery, or had a gross taste to it. The Starbucks variety was fine, but overly expensive for what you got. Then I tried this boxed Columbia brew. It is a little more expensive than some of the concentrates, but given to you at the perfect concentration (imo, very strong even with ice. Coming from someone who drank 4 espressos a day before switching to cold brew). The taste is also WAY smoother, with a bold non-acidic flavor that can be enjoyed by itself or with milk. If you like to add a flavored creamer or syrup, it’s also smooth enough to not overpower that flavor It’s also incredibly convenient to just put in the fridge, and it lasts a little over a week for me (I drink about 1x 28 oz bottle a day). Definitely recommend Read more | 5.0\nThere is zero coffee flavor! It’s like drinking water. I loved the convenance of a cold brew on tap but this is just over priced brown water. Read more | 1.0\nTaste: 4 Stars Convenience: 1 Star Decent tasting cold brew coffee. Not quite as good as the Monster Java cold brew that I have purchased in the individual cans but the cost on those have shot up. Decided to try this as there is less packaging cost and less waste in a single container but I have limited shelf space in my fridge and the selling point for me was the built in pour spout on the NARROW side of the box. With the narrow side facing out as shown in the picture the box can be placed on the top shelf and can be used to dispense the coffee into your mug without moving or removing the box from the fridge. The box arrived with the pour spout safely tucked inside the box which is good for protecting it during shipping especially when shipped in a bubble wrap. The frustrating thing is that not only is there no perforated circle to punch out and feed the spout through but the spout is centered 3” from the bottom and wide side of the bag instead of the side you want facing the front for easy access. The container without the box of course would haphazardly roll around the fridge shelf like a ziplock freezer bag full of water most likely falling onto the floor at some point. Without a perforated hole or even a printed circle to cut out I had to measure the widest diameter of the plastic ring with a tape measure, grab a compass to draw an appropriately sized circle but even then I had to make the opening on the wide side of the box and there is no room in my fridge to place the box on the one shelf tall enough for it with the “convenient” pour spout potentially accessible. As it is now the spout has to sit facing sideways which not only makes it inaccessible from using while sitting in the fridge but the spout is just in the way for placing anything on the shelf next to it or against the wall. So even AFTER having to manually measure, trace a cutout circle and grab a utility knife to make the pour spout accessible I still have to pick up the box, move it to a kitchen counter top somewhere that is too low for conveniently using the pour spout. Packaging Design department: You had one job to do. Make the pour spout accessible for use from the narrow front side of the box while it remains in the fridge.🙄 Read more | 3.0\nI read that some people have an issue with the spout. It would be hard for the manufacturer to get it in the box with the spout perfectly aligned, especially after shipping. It is simple to twist it into the right position. The taste is great. It keeps well and makes the mornings convenient. Read more | 5.0\nLeaking from bag Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n1.0",

Its best and delicious than 7-11 MOCHA ICED COFFEE!!!! I never tried MOCHA from Starbucks... When I ordered, got and tried it first time and my friend live in differ state... HE LOVE MOCHA TOO!!! So I decided to order it for him!!! He love it too!!! Also funny is his wife NOT much drink any FRAPPE, MOCHA and others... BUT When she see it and she say I want to try it and SHE LOVE IT AND DRINK IT MANY TIMES!!!! Then they did ordered it!!! 1 day I gave it to my friend and when she first sip and she say WOW ITS DELICIOUS AND ITS BEST THAN STARBUCKS!!! 1 day I decided bring it for my church... I made ICED MOCHA at home early morning and people who want HOT MOCHA they can make themselves for HOT MOCHA... So ALL PEOPLE WHO TRIED IT ALL SAY SAME ITS DELICIOUS, THEY ALL LOVE IT AND THEY ALL LIKE IT!!! ALSO THEY ASKED ME WHERE BUY IT??? THEY WANT TO ORDER IT!!!! 1 time I ordered it 2 bags and I got it differ its NOT BLUE... ITS BROWN BAG!!!??? I got solution with it refunded and they say I can keep it... OK Then I tried it and its OK BUT THIS 1 BLUE BAG BEST AND CHAMP!!!! So far I have seen people who drink and try it and ALL LOVE IT AND SAY ITS GOOD, BEST AND TASTE DIFFER NOT SAME AS STARBUCKS, 7-11 AND OTHERS... ITS MOST DELICIOUS AND BEST MOCHA EVER!!!!!! I agree with all other customer reviews say about it that you will addiction, addictive, its best and others.... I have many differ kinds of drink flavors... 1 thing I noticed that this BLUE BAG MOCHA RUN OUT VERY FAST THAN ALL OTHER FLAVORS??? I think I KNOW WHY AND GOT IT... Because all other drinks make single serving 16oz cup!!! BUT for this make single serving 8oz!!!! I ALWAYS DRINK any flavors 16oz a night every night and drink this every Sunday morning 16oz too sometimes other day drink this night too... So everytimes I make this drink I HAVE TO MAKE IT DOUBLE TO MAKE IT 16oz... So I think better they should make it single serving 16oz ( make this bag 6lb instead 3lb or something thats way have it longer... Because all others drink flavors are single serving 16oz and its long time to run out and order more... This run out very fast because every time I drink it I have to make it double to make it 16oz and make it run out faster!!!! ) IDK What about all other people drink 16oz or 8oz??? My friends and a friend and his wife always drink 16oz too... So thats make it run out ( OUT OF STOCK ) fast they probably use and drink 16oz too and need more... So PLEASE KEEP SELL THIS BLUE BAG MOCHA MY FRIENDS, OTHER PEOPLE AND I WILL ORDER THIS!!!! Make it 16oz single serving its should be better... If they want 8oz then they can cut it half... Its easy... So I think better should make it a bag with single serving 16oz so thats way we have it longer than single serving 8oz and have to make it double and it will run out faster and need order again more soon... ( I mean if its make 16oz single serving then need to buy and order it more later 5 months later ( depend how often they, you and I drink it... I drink it every Sunday morning and sometimes other night too... Most times I drink it once or twice a week ) so but its 8oz single servings and I have to order it more about 2 months later before it run out so I have it more to drink when it run out then open new bag.... BUT If 16oz single servings then more longer later like 5 months later.... Read more | 5.0\nI love it with my coffee. Read more | 5.0\nTaste great. No weird aftertaste like most I've tried.

I've been buying the Javvy Coffee Concentrate for at least 8 months now and I'm addicted.  My favorite flavor is the caramel.  It is so good and so easy to use.

Read more | 5.0\nJavvy Coffee Concentrate is incredibly convenient, providing me with the perfect solution for both iced and hot coffee cravings. The rich, smooth flavor is fantastic, definitely one of the convenient cold brew concentrates I've tried. Each cup is super easy to prepare; I just mix it with water or milk based on my mood, and in no time, I have a delicious coffee ready to enjoy from the comfort of my home. I like that I can easily adjust the strength according to my preference, which is a great perk. Read more | 4.0\nI use Javy nearly every day. I switched from consuming energy drinks and drive through coffees to Javy and I couldn’t be happier with the flavor and how much money I’ve saved. I love the variety of flavors that are available, the Coconut Caramel Cookie is my favorite of the moment. It’s also so much easier to make coffee this way, I can make a coffee in less than a minute and I don’t have to wait on a machine to warm up and brew coffee. It’s definitely a great option for people who don’t have a lot of time in the morning. I enjoy this company and will continue to purchase from them. Read more | 5.0\nI had been seeing Jot advertised pretty heavily and wanted to try it out, signing up for a new subscription seemed annoying so I searched Amazon for Jot and came away with Javy. It seemed like a good deal, 30 cups of cofefe for $23, cheaper if I liked it and subscribed. I got it and made my first cup with just one spoonful of concentrate, tasted kind of watered down so I added a second. Decently flavored, very easy to make, nice caffeine boost. However, over the following two weeks, I noticed that I was almost never finishing my cofefe until lunch, if not after, not at all normal for me as I can normally drain two trentas before I've finished my breakfast. I continued to see Jot advertised pretty strongly though and decided to read some comparisons. Every comparison talked about how much better tasting Jot was than Javy. I also saw that Jot was having a promotion where if you signed up you got a free travel mug, no subscription required and even money back for 20 days. So I decided to say screw it and sign up. My Jot and my mug arrived yesterday, but it was the afternoon and I don't like that much caffeine that late in the day, so I waited until this morning. Washed out the mug and made a glass of Jot iced coffee. Oh. My. God. Delicious. Had not had a cup of cofefe this good without paying all over $5 and waiting in a ten minute line. After draining the mug in two sips I thought to myself okay, maybe it's just because this mug is smaller than the one I typically use for my Javy. So I took the mug, and made a cup of Javy iced coffee. Same amount of concentrate, creamer and ice as I had just used. Tasted extremely watery to me. At this point I decided to do a price comparison. Is it okay that I need to use twice as much concentrate to still get less flavor? A 6oz bottle of Javy sans subscription is $22.95 currently; that comes out to $3.825/oz of concentrate. If you subscribe it brings it down to $19.508 or $3.251/oz. Jot on the other hand is a 6.8oz bottle for $26; that comes out to $3.824/oz. If you subscribe it reduces down to $19.50 or $2.868/oz. So no matter how you do it, Jot is quite a bit cheaper, more so when you factor in how much you need for a delicious cup. For the caffeine content Javy makes it very difficult to figure out how much you get as the numbers on the back of the bottle say 100mg for 1-2 tsp of concentrate. Going off the figures online it seems to be 60mg of caffeine per serving with 1tsb listed as the serving though, which comes out to 180mg/tbsp. Jot is very straightforward no matter where you look, it's 150mg/tbsp. So you do theoretically get more caffeine in Javy than you do with Jot. However, that's if it's really 60mg/tsp. The way it's printed on the bottle makes me think they are using rounding on the tsp measurement to make this claim, since 6oz is actually 36tsp where they advertise 30 servings, which is 1.2 tsp/serving which would mean there is really 50mg/tsp. The 50mg/tsp also lines up with using tsp to get 100mg as printed on the back of the bottle. This all makes me believe that the caffeine content between the two is actually equal, however because of Javy's mixed messaging this is UNCONFIRMED. Tl;dr All in all, Javy is very easy to make and when you use enough concentrate is decent tasting and POSSIBLY has a little bit extra caffeine. However, Jot blows it away on the flavor, is cheaper, and just as easy to make. Read more | 3.0\nI have been using Javvy coffee concentrate for about a year and I couldn't be more pleased with this product. My original purchase was directly from Javvy; they offer single bottles as well as subscription packages, and now I see that you can purchase single bottles through amazon. I have always enjoyed iced coffee but got tired of having to make a large pot of hot coffee for that purpose and it's difficult to find coffee concentrate in the grocery stores near me. I found out about Javvy from an online ad and decided to give it a try. I don't get fancy; one teaspoon of coffee concentrate in ice and water with a little coffee creamer and voila, delicious iced coffee. Javvy offers a variety of flavors (I personally prefer the French Vanilla), including coffee with no flavoring. Since you only (typically) use a teaspoon of concentrate, one bottle lasts quite a while. I highly recommend Javvy coffee concentrate and will definitely be purchasing more.

I pour over ice and pair it with a hard boiled egg or banana and it keeps me satisfied until lunch. I’ve tried chocolate and caramel and they’re both great.

However, it is far too sweet and I had to cut it using milk to be able to consume it.  Unfortunately I will have to keep looking for the perfect protein shake.

I can't stand the flavor. It's not chalky like regular protein drinks are, that's not the issue... it tastes like I'm drinking an amalgamation of seeds (not in a good way). It even has the bitterness of a seed shell. Nowhere in this does it taste like coffee, or any of the coffee flavors listed (example vanilla latte). I tried adding Splenda and the taste got worse. I really wanted to love these but I can't get past the taste. Read more | 3.0\nThese are very good protien shakes. They are easy to grab and go and provide 20 grams of protien. They don't have the usual chalkiness of other protien drinks and the flavor is also really good. They are a little pricy but worth it for those who need a non dairy option. The bottles are a good size to toss in your purse or gym bag on the way out the door.

Monk fruit extract is used instead, and it gives the drink a cloying sweetness that lingers in your mouth for quite a while. It's not as bad as stevia or aspartame, and there is no obvious aftertaste, just a strange, lingering sweetness which I find unpleasant. I imagine that if cane sugar was used instead, it would taste a lot better, and the company would still be able to advertise that there are no \"artificial sweeteners.\" Compared to other protein coffee drinks available on Amazon, the price is pretty good. If you don't mind the cloying sweetness of zero-calorie sweeteners, then this stuff is probably a good buy for you. If you're sensitive to the weirdness and aftertaste that comes with them, like I am, I would stay away. Read more | 3.0",

    "description": "The dream to offer the best coffee to the world, since 1933. Over the years, illy has perfected this process to obtain a coffee with a rich aromatic profile, balanced flavor and a one-of-a-kind aroma. To make our coffee, we select only the finest Arabica coffee plants, grown sustainably by our farmers in over 30 countries around the world. We cultivate long-lasting relationships with them based on shared values and personal growth. Because it is only by working together that we can achieve exceptional results.We select only the 1% of the finest Arabica coffee beans, thanks to many years of collaboration with growers who place maximum importance on quality and sustainability. Researching and experimenting with raw materials is a journey that never ends. After processing, the beans undergo a meticulous selection to ensure zero defects: even a single imperfect Arabica coffee bean can compromise the aroma of our blend. We preserve and enhance the aromas through our patented pressurized cans. Patented in 1934 by illy, pressurization is a preservation system in which the air in the tin is replaced by an inert gas at a pressure greater than that of the atmosphere. In this way, not only is the freshness of our coffee maintained, but its aroma is also enhanced.  To obtain the best sustainable quality, illy sources the finest Arabica around the world, establishes a lasting relationship with the growers and nurtures a virtuous circle, generating well-being for consumers and socio-economic development for producers.",

    "reviews": "Blonde Intense NESCAFÉ Gold Espresso Intense is a staple in my house! I use it primarily to make iced coffees, and it never disappoints. The coffee has a rich, bold flavor that’s perfect for cold brew-style drinks. I love that it dissolves quickly, so I can easily mix it with water or milk, and it creates a smooth, flavorful iced coffee every time. The 3.5 oz size is convenient for frequent use, and it lasts a good amount of time. It’s easy to keep on hand, and I always have it ready to go when I need a pick-me-up. Whether you enjoy it hot or iced, the intense flavor is perfect for coffee lovers. Highly recommend this if you’re looking for a reliable, flavorful instant coffee! Read more | 5.0\nThe moment I opened the jar, I was hit with an aroma so rich and inviting, I knew I was about to experience something truly indulgent. This blonde espresso isn’t just coffee—it’s an experience, a slow, sensual awakening that teases you with every sip. The smooth, golden crema settles beautifully on top, a promise of what’s to come. It’s bold yet delicate, strong yet smooth—the kind of balance that keeps you coming back for more. With every taste, the deep, roasted notes dance on my tongue, warming me up from the inside out. It’s instant gratification, but with a lingering finish that leaves me craving another round. Whether I take it hot and steamy or iced and refreshing, it never disappoints. It’s the kind of coffee that hits just right, every single time. If you like your mornings full-bodied, rich, and intensely satisfying, this is the one. Five stars—I’d wake up for this every day. Read more | 5.0\nI can’t believe I waited so long to try this honestly! I love starting my day off with coffee and definitely need a caffeine boost as I typically work 10-14 hour days. This is so easy to make a quick cup when I need it. When I make a pot of coffee I always end up making more than I need leaving me with a mess to pick up and wasting some. I’ve enjoyed the taste both iced and hot and truly feel an energy boost! It’s my go to option now instead of buying energy drinks. I’m on my fourth jar now and keep telling all my friends to try it! Great value for the price. Read more | 5.0\nDelicious but you need two teaspoons or more for good flavor. Value for money is good for a decent sized bottle of instant espresso. You can easily take this with you anywhere. If making an Americano need multiple spoonfuls. One teaspon is only good for a shot of espresso. Tastes toasty, bitter, nutty and  dark chocolatey. Smooth with a little froth. Read more | 5.0\nDelicious! Easy to make and tastes so good. I am not a regular coffee drinker but I went to Mexico recently and we bought some of this for morning coffees and it was so good I got some when I came back home. It's creamy, velvety, and froths very nicely. I also use it to add to a protein shake sometimes, chefs kiss! Read more | 5.0\nNESCAFÉ Gold Espresso Blonde has a smooth and mild flavor with a nice, subtle aroma. It dissolves quickly and makes a great light espresso, though it might be too mild for those who prefer a strong, bold coffee. The 3.5 oz jar lasts a good while, making it a convenient option for instant coffee lovers. Would love a bit more richness, but overall, a solid choice! Read more | 4.0\nThis espresso makes as a game changer for busy mornings! It’s super convenient. All I have to do is just mix with water and you have a quick smooth espresso in. The flavor is surprisingly rich and well balanced, not too bitter or weak.

    "reviews": "Salted Caramel Mocha Java Mint Mocha French Vanilla Champions Blend - Mocha Black Variety I was excited to try the Throne Sport Coffee Variety Pack, and it did not disappoint! The quality of this Arabica bean coffee is excellent – smooth, rich, and never bitter. Each can delivers a refreshing cold brew experience with just the right amount of natural sweetness, without any dairy or unnecessary additives. The taste is incredible! Each flavor is well-balanced, bold, and satisfying. I love that it’s low-calorie yet still gives a great energy boost without any crash. The added electrolytes make it perfect for athletes or anyone who needs hydration and sustained focus throughout the day. For the price, it’s a fantastic deal considering the premium ingredients and convenience. Whether you need a pre-workout boost, a midday pick-me-up, or just love high-quality iced coffee, this is a must-try. I’ll definitely be ordering again! Read more | 5.0\nI like to go running to stay fit and clear my head from my busy work and family commitments. On a non work out day, I love a nice espresso- hot and flavorful. But if I’m running, I need a little more. That’s where Thone Sport Coffee comes in!  This tasty iced coffee has all the caffeine I need plus a bunch of vital minerals and supplements that keep my energy, stamina and endurance up. I’ve tried a number of pre-work out drinks over the years and most leave me feeling jittery and a little ill. But not Throne!  It’s a perfect balance of flavor, energy and nutrients that gets it just right. And the price is right too!!  Highly recommend giving it a try! Read more | 5.0\nI recently picked up this canned coffee for those crazy mornings when I'm running late for work, and it's been a game-changer! It’s delicious and smooth, with just the right amount of kick from 150mg of natural caffeine to keep me focused and energized throughout the day. No more dragging by mid-morning! What really sold me on this drink was the fact that it's packed with B vitamins, BCAAs, and electrolytes, which is perfect for someone like me who's always on the go. Not only does it taste great (I tried the Mocha Java and Salted Caramel flavors, both of which are delicious), but it also helps with hydration and muscle recovery. Plus, it's super low in calories and sugar, which is a huge bonus if you're watching your intake. The Mocha Java and Salted Caramel flavor have 50 calories and 8g of natural cane sugar each, while the Black flavor is even lighter at 25 calories and just 1g of sugar! The best part? A 4-pack is only $15! It's a fantastic grab-and-go option for work, and I love that I don't have to sacrifice flavor or health benefits. Highly recommend if you're looking for a tasty, convenient, and health-conscious coffee option! Read more | 5.0\nI bought the variety pack not knowing what to expect. I normally have an iced latte in the morning and another after lunch so I'm a big coffee drinker. If you're expecting this to taste like an iced latte, this is not it, but if you're looking for a way to get your caffeine fix in a light, refreshing drink, that's what this is. It's only 50 calories and to me tastes way better than a plain black coffee. I like that there are B vitamins and electrolytes which makes it great for a pre-workout without the crazy jitters. I drank half the can and felt the caffeine. It's a little pricey, but honestly it's on par with other already made pre-workout drinks. I would definitely use this as a preworkout. Read more | 4.0\nThrone Sport Coffee is a solid choice if you need a clean energy boost without the jitters. It’s packed with natural ingredients that support focus, endurance, and recovery, making it great for workouts or long days. The taste is smooth, not overly bitter, and blends well with milk or a shake. If you're looking for a coffee that fuels both your mind and body, this is worth trying! 🚀☕ Read more | 5.0\nRough tasting Read more | 3.0\nThe media could not be loaded. There is no denying that the flavor's of these drinks are rather subpar. I rank the flavors from highest to lowest like this: 1. French Vanilla 2. Mocha Java 3. Black 4.(Or wayy back there) Salted Caramel. The flavors could definitely be improved. However, I would have to say that the energy and motivation I got on the days that I drank these drinks was rather surprising! I never got the shakes or quakes that some energy drinks give me. These just seemed to put me on a whole other level of getting \"S\" done! And for that, I have to give it 4 stars! If you can slam the can and get passed the taste, or just by the French Vanilla one I'd say It's really good! However, getting the variety pack and having to drink Salted Caramel and Black is less than ideal Read more | 4.0\nAwesome cold brew! Smooth, bold, and just the right amount of kick. The variety pack keeps things interesting, and it's super convenient for on-the-go energy. Perfect for workouts, busy days, or just a solid caffeine fix. Highly recommend! 💪☕🔥 Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "I am a canned coffee latte drinker who enjoys drinks that are sweet and creamy while still retaining a noticable coffee flavor.  And I don't find a lot of drinks that check both of those boxes.  Out of what I have tried, the Starbucks Espresso and Cream cans and Bones Coffee Co canned cold brew lattes cans are my favorates. And I was pleasantly surprised when I bought this boxed cold brew latte in a whim to find it sweet, with a creamy mouthfeel and a noticable coffee bite to it.  This is right up there with my favorate drinks.  Coffee taste is more acidic than bitter so I am thinking the roast level is lighter than you often see with a cold brew in a can. Be warned though that the specific caffine content is unlisted and I suspect that at the 6 oz serviving size, you are getting something fairly potent for a small portion of latte. . .maybe 100+ mg of caffine.  So avoid filling a big mug in one go if you are sensitve to that. Otherwise, this is a real gem if your canned coffee tastes run similiar to mine. Read more | 5.0\nWell, I never had a chance to taste it. It smelled good but unfortunately it had big black chunks in it so I just  threw it away. I certainly did not want to take a chance. It was very unappetizing. I do not recommend this. Read more | 1.0\nI’m usually a nitro cold brew drinker.  The stronger, the better.  No sweeter, no added flavoring.  But, I gave this one a shot, and I am not disappointed.  First of all, it isn’t too sweet which is key.  I don’t like sugar or syrup in my coffee and I was skeptical.  The sweetness tastes more natural than added.  Also the vanilla is just enough.  All the flavors shine through and it feels like I could have this mid morning or mid afternoon and not feel bloated or like I just consider a sugary treat.  The to-go box is convenient.  I like that it sits right inside my fridge and is ready when I am.

Will keep these in stock. Read more | 5.0\nI discovered these coffees while in undergrad and have been hooked ever since. I work in a hospital and have early mornings sometimes so these are great to pick up on the go when you don't have time to get the coffee maker going. Flavor is great and just the right amount of caffeine to get your day started. Read more | 4.0\nEasily one of my favorite coffees. I wish they would make an almond milk version. Read more | 5.0\nAnother impulse buy. Will have to curb that habit. Taste is sweet and a bit metallic. I think 11g of added sugar is a lot in a 9oz can...22% of daily recommended amount. For me the coffee flavor wasn't strong and was overpowered by the sweet. But then this comes from a person whose everday beverage is 4 shots of espresso with a little unsweetened oatmilk. I may not be the right person to judge sweet coffee. I pay $4.19 for my drink so at an average of $3.50 depending on if it's on sale I think it's pricy for what you get. Another thing is it foamed immediately upon opening. I've picked this up for a coworker a couple of times and it was frothy when she poured it in a glass but I didn't know it was like that instantly. I attributed it to her shaking and pouring. Don't know how/why it happens so I can't say that's a negative. My overall take is been there done that not looking back.

    "reviews": "Sugar-Free Variety Pack Sugar-Free French Vanilla Sugar-Free Double Mocha Starter Variety Pack Salted Caramel Rich Variety Pack Mocha Mint Hazelnut Classic Cappuccino Limited Edition Holiday 3-Pack Large Pouch French Vanilla Sugar Cookie Gingerbread French Vanilla Fat-Free French Vanilla English Toffee Double Mocha Decaf French Vanilla White Chocolate Caramel It is my new favorite. It is the perfect blend of espresso and chocolate. Not too sweet and not too bitter if made using the instructions on the package. If you find you like this flavor make sure to try the others. They are easy to find in your local grocery, sadly Double Mocha I have only found online. Back in the 90s, I fell in love with convenience store cappuccino but only certain ones. I tried coffee shop cappuccino but it just didn't carry the same flavor it was always bitter. Then one day my favorite convenience store started selling the brand they used in 24 oz containers and I found out the brand I had come to love was Superior brand French Vanilla Cappuccino. I then discovered I could purchase the same cappuccino at the local grocery store and that it came in two other flavors White Chocolate Carmel and English Toffee. I was in heaven! However, all good things end and I stopped finding the Superior brand anywhere. I got online and found they had sold the company to Hills Bros. I checked and found the same flavors now in Hills Bros packaging and purchased the French Vanilla. It was the flavor I had come to know and love.  Later I discovered they had another flavor I had never seen Double Mocha. I could not find it anywhere for sale locally and when I looked online you could only buy it in bulk of 3 to 6 containers at a time or 1 container for 3 times what you pay for the others. I did not give up hope and continued to search every once in a while to see if I could find one reasonably priced. I finally did and I have to say the wait was worth it. Update: This was a great value. They were selling for the same price as offered in the stores, but overnight, the price jumped by 40%, making it not worth the extra bucks. Read more | 5.0\nOne good delicious instant coffee at that and it REALLY DOES tastes exactly like English Toffee through and Through! I was hesitant buying this but the customer reviews plus the ridiculously affordable price that convinced me to take the plunge and take the gamble and Boy I sure did lucked out on this one! I've drinking instant flavored coffees like this since I was a teenager but this is the first I've tasted really delicious coffee and the flavor is right on point and not just a hint but the real true flavor of what English Toffee is supposed to taste like. This is gonna be in my coffee rotation and it's now staying in the menu and I highly recommend this coffee brand! Read more | 5.0\nThey kept sending me the wrong flavor.  I got refunds, and was able to keep the wrong ones.  But didn’t really like them.  Once I finally started receiving the correct flavor, Mocha Mint, I came up with an excellent recipe for my morning iced Mochas that I take to work in a little canteen. Hear me out on this: Take a gallon jug and fill it about half way with HOT water.  Use a funnel or something and dump in an entire pound package of the Mocha Mint mix.  Probably any flavor will work.  Add 2/3 cup of instant coffee grounds.  Pro tip: After measuring the coffee grounds, I like to grind them up in a mortar/pestle into powder so it dissolves better.  Put the cap on the gallon jug and shake the crap out of it so everything dissolves really good.  Now fill the rest of the jug with fat free (skim) milk and put it into the fridge for later. Makes awesome iced Mochas, ready to drink.  I just fill up my 12oz canteen every morning to take to work and keep it cold.  Plus a glass or two on weekend days.  For my consumption, a gallon lasts me about a week.  I buy a gallon of skim milk and make 2 gallons of mocha at a time, making sure the expiration date on the milk is good for close to a couple weeks away. Cost comes out to $7.63/gallon for the Mocha mix and the milk (I didn’t calculate the cost of the coffee grounds, they’re so cheap). Calories are about 169/cup. I’d be curious to know if anyone else does something like this too. **EDIT TO MY RECIPE FOR ULTIMATE SIMPLICITY** Start with 2 empty gallon jugs (like milk jugs). Dump 1 cup of instant coffee grounds in each jug.  I use disposable paper funnels, and I stopped bothering to grind up the instant coffee. Dump 1 container of cappuccino mix in each jug.  (Do this all outside because the powder flies around like dust) Now pour 6 cups of HOT tap water in each jug. Cap the jugs and shake until powder is dissolved.  Best to do an initial shake, then another shake a while later to let the powder soak up the water. Put the jugs in the fridge until cool, like overnight. Now you can pour skim milk in each jug to fill them up and complete the recipe.  If you’ve done it correctly, it will now take exactly one gallon of skim milk to fill both jugs basically to their tops. Now that you have two gallons of pre-made iced mocha, you can put one or both of the jugs in the freezer and take them out as needed.  Just remember that they’ll swell when they freeze, so I squeeze the jugs first to remove the air at the top, then put the caps on.  That way the liquid has some room to expand without busting the jugs. Bonus:  Rinse out the skim milk jug and use it for making more iced mocha next time.  I like making 2-4 gallons (or more) at a time to save myself time and not have to buy milk so often.  Got plenty of room in my freezer for it. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the Hills Bros. Instant Cappuccino Mix in the Sugar Free French Vanilla flavor, and it's a great option for a quick and easy coffee fix. The flavor is rich and creamy, with a nice balance of vanilla that isn't too overpowering. It's a convenient choice for those who want a tasty cappuccino without the added sugar. The mix dissolves well in hot water, creating a smooth and frothy beverage. It's perfect for busy mornings or when you need a quick pick-me-up during the day. The 12 oz pack is also a good size, providing plenty of servings. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that I wish the flavor was a bit stronger. However, it's still a delicious and satisfying option for anyone looking for a sugar-free cappuccino mix. Read more | 4.0\nThis is my 2nd or 3rd purchase of this product.

    "reviews": "Coffee Strawberry Banana Smooth Vanilla Dark Chocolate Cookies & Creamless 3 Flavor Variety: Strawberry Banana 3 Flavor Variety: Smooth Vanilla 3 Flavor Variety: Dark Chocolate Cold Brew Coffee OWYN Protein Shakes are amazing! I’ve tried so many plant-based shakes, and this one stands out. The flavor is smooth and delicious—none of that chalky or overly sweet aftertaste. It’s the perfect grab-and-go option for busy days or post-workout recovery. I love that it’s packed with 20g of protein, plus it’s completely free of dairy, gluten, and soy—perfect for anyone with dietary restrictions. The added omega-3s and superfoods are a bonus, making it feel more like real nutrition than just a protein drink. It’s hard to find something that tastes this good and is also good for you. I’m hooked and will definitely keep these stocked in my fridge! Highly recommend giving it a try. Read more | 5.0\nI like the variety. You can find them in the stores but not the variety pack. It taste good. It doesn’t need to be kept cold, tho I think it taste better chilled. Keeps me full for a few hours which helps reduce snacking. Good meal replacement Read more | 5.0\nI love that OWYN protein drinks are vegan, soy-free, and gluten-free, making them a great option for those with dietary restrictions. With 20g of protein, low carbs, and low sugar (no sugar alcohols!), they’re a solid choice for a quick grab-and-go breakfast or post-workout fuel. ✅ Clean ingredients – No dairy, soy, or gluten. ✅ Good macros – High protein without unnecessary sugar. ✅ Versatile – Tastes much better when blended with fruit or used in a dirty soda (not the healthiest, but delicious!). The only downside is the taste—it’s okay but the vanilla and oreo have a noticeable aftertaste.  The cold brew coffee one is the best! If you’re used to plant-based protein drinks, it’s manageable, but mixing it with other flavors helps a lot. Overall, a good option for convenience and clean nutrition, just don’t expect a milkshake! Read more | 4.0\nI recently tried the OWYN plant-based protein shake in the flavor “cookies and creamless,” and I must say, it's surprisingly good for a protein drink! Many protein shakes can be thick, chalky, and have an unpleasant flavor, but this one has a nice consistency and a flavor that I genuinely enjoy without the chalkiness. There is a slight aftertaste, but it’s much milder compared to other protein powders or drinks I’ve tried. It has a very long shelf life. The price is what I would expect and is comparable. As someone with lactose intolerance, I appreciate that this shake doesn’t upset my stomach at all, making it a perfect option for me. As a nurse practitioner, I also feel good about choosing this protein shake because it seems like a very clean choice. Overall, it’s a protein drink that I look forward to enjoying, and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a tasty and easy way to get their protein! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not a huge fan of protein drinks, especially vegan ones. I’m a bigger fan of green shakes, but these were easy to drink and provide the protein I need. Wish they’d make them in strawberry! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been taste testing a lot of these types of shakes because the one I’ve been drinking seems to have vanished from the world. These are maybe the least offensive ones I’ve had but can’t say I love them. They have an almost coffee like flavor, which is fine if you like coffee. Maybe I will get used to them? They seem like the best alternative to what I was drinking so I will probably give them a chance for a while. Read more | 3.0\nThought I'd try these are a meal replacement instead of other brands that give me pains and constipation.  These are great. No chalky taste or overly thick shake quality.  I got the variety pack and all of the flavors are good.  The cookie/cream seems a bit too sweet,  maybe, for my taste. But love the dark chocolate.  I drink them cold from the fridge, no mixing at all. Smooth texture, easy to carry , and I can recycle the bottles. Read more | 5.0\nIt's ok. The flavors are ok. The Dark Chocolate gives me severe heartburn and causes me to burp a lot. The coffee and cookies and cream flavor are decent, I'll not be getting the coffee or dark chocolate flavors again though. The coffee just doesn't taste good enough. I've read about a chalky taste in other reviews but I didn't have that issue. No clumps or anything either. Texture is thick like a watery shake, most of the ingredients mean nothing to me. My daughter put me on a diet and when she spent 2 weeks researching a good diet for me this drink was listed as the #2 best offering for meal replacement drinks, the first option was far far to expensive.  To keep the daughter happy I'll be getting more as needed. Read more | 4.0\n5.0\n5.0",

Read more | 5.0\nBest tasting but so expensive Read more | 5.0\nThese are less expensive than the three listed in the title, so that is definitely worthwhile if you buy these often.  I have one shake a day, minimum, and that means I am buying often. However, thesexarentbquite as good as the others, despite very similar macros. I'm looking for 30g of protein at the lowest calorie count and carb count possible and I prefer chocolate. These have 4 net carbs, while Pure Protein has 3. Thos also has the highest calorie count at 170. I don't have the others in front of me right now, but they all have 2 to 4 net carbs and 160-170 calories. They all have 30 g Protein. Pure protein, Orgain, and Atkins (high protein) are really delicious, with Pure Protein and Atkins having a more flavorful chocolate taste...with depth and richness. Orgain is pretty good, but wasn't a favorite until I reached the end of a 12 pack, and decided it was very good.  I had a Pure Protein after that, and decided Orgain was just as good. These Quest drinks do not have much of a chocolate flavor at all. They are good, they have a great texture and sweet mild flavor, but don't taste very chocolate...there's no depth to thecdrink...just sweetness, sort of like a vanilla drink. It's actually just sweet and smooth, with no flavor BUT sweetness. So while the macros are what I'm looking for, my next purchase will likely be the Pure Protein in Rich Chocolate. If they're out of stick as they often are, I'd get Atkins or Orgain, depending on price. Atkins has quite a few 15g protein drinks. I'm referring to their higher protein option-' that one has 30g.

I love it as an evening drink that won'tt keep you awake or for a second cup of coffee in the morning. Easy to use and a real bargain. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the Maxwell House International Hazelnut Café-Style Instant Coffee Beverage Mix, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations. The hazelnut flavor is rich and aromatic, making each cup a delightful treat. It's incredibly easy to prepare—just add hot water, stir, and enjoy. The 9 oz. canister is perfect for keeping at home or in the office for a quick coffee fix. I love that it's versatile; you can enjoy it hot or cold, and it even works well as a creamer for regular coffee. The only reason I'm giving it four stars instead of five is that I wish the hazelnut flavor was a bit stronger.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Latte Toffee Mocha Pralines n' Cream Caramel Latte I'm absolutely smitten with Big Train Frappé Mix! As a coffee lover who enjoys experimenting with different flavors, this mix has become a staple in my kitchen. It's so versatile and allows me to create cafe-quality frappes right at home. What I Love: Flavor Variety: Big Train offers an impressive range of flavors, from classic mocha and vanilla to more unique options like cake batter and salted caramel. There's something for everyone! Easy to Prepare: Just blend with ice and milk (or your preferred milk alternative) for a quick and delicious treat. No fancy equipment needed. Consistent Quality: Each batch delivers the same rich, creamy, and flavorful experience. I never have to worry about inconsistencies. Great Value: The large bags last for a good number of servings, making it a cost-effective option compared to buying frappes at coffee shops. My Favorite Ways to Use It: Classic Frappé: Blended with milk and ice, it's the perfect pick-me-up. Protein Shake: Add a scoop of protein powder for a satisfying and nutritious post-workout shake. Coffee Alternative: For non-coffee drinkers, the vanilla or mocha flavors make a delightful iced treat. Dessert Topping: Drizzle over ice cream or waffles for an extra burst of flavor. Overall: Big Train Frappé Mix is a fantastic product for coffee lovers and anyone who enjoys a delicious and refreshing iced beverage. It's convenient, delicious, and versatile enough to satisfy a variety of preferences. I highly recommend it! Read more | 5.0\nThis one is priced right, taste great and is my preferred mix now. Thank you. I save a fortune making my own at home now. Read more | 5.0\nI've tried over the years saving money by making my own frappes at home and this stuff is the only way it tastes like at a Cafe. Delicious !! I've bought a few bags and it lasts a very long time! Read more | 5.0\nI like treating myself to a caramel frappe from Starbucks since it tastes very good, so I tried this drink mix with chilled water. Tastes exactly the same minus the whipped cream and crushed ice so I'm very pleased with the product. The only thing I don't like is how calorie dense it is (300/serving), not to mention the sugar content. Read more | 4.0\nLove frappes hate paying for them lol and I used the coupon amazon had on them and got it for 18 bucks now I can make it myself I'm super thrilled and don't have to go out in the cold in the morning anymore the mix tastes great and when I get the craving now I have the fix for myself super excited!! Read more | 5.0\nI love the frappes from my local coffee shop because they use powder instead of syrup but I rarely go out and one of the employees told me they used this brand. I held onto that for years and I finally made the purchase and am so glad I did! I don't have the specific recipe they use and I'm not sure if they use the vanilla latte or vanilla bean mix but the instructions on the back of the bag tastes very close. I always get espresso added too so I opted for the vanilla latte mix to try first and it's delicious, I might try the vanilla bean next time to compare. The smell reminds me of the yummy vanilla calcium chew vitamins I had as a kid that I wanted to eat like candy! I did also buy the caramel flavor which is good but not my favorite. I personally don't like the fake syrupy taste that comes with caramel flavorings and though this is much, much better than the syrups I've tried it still does have that taste. The back of the bags has a recipe for iced, blended, and hot. My favorite of the three is definitely blended. You do have to use quite a bit of powder per drink as well but can cut black a little to extend the bag. Overall I'd definitely recommend trying these, the vanilla will definitely have a space in the cupboard from now on! Read more | 5.0\nwhile there are some positive aspects, there's also room for improvement. On the plus side, the convenience of this blend is undeniable. It's quick and easy to prepare, which is great for my busy mornings. The packaging is also well-designed, keeping the powder fresh over time. However, when it comes to flavor, the coffee falls a bit short of my expectations. It's decent for a quick cup, but it lacks the depth and richness I look for in a good coffee. The aroma is pleasant, but the taste doesn't fully deliver on that promise, coming across as somewhat flat and one-dimensional. For those who prioritize convenience and are looking for an affordable, no-fuss coffee option, this could be a suitable choice. But if you're a coffee aficionado seeking a complex and robust flavor profile, you might find this blend a bit lacking. Overall, it's a decent product but not exceptional.

    "reviews": "Was never a coffee person until I went to Japan. I’ve tried Starbucks, Dunkin, local coffee houses near me, and sure I like a hot chocolate every now and then, but never could I get into coffee. The bitterness was always too much. But then I went to Japan, and tried this canned coffee at the recommendation of a friend who bought it at FamilyMart on a whim. Immediately, my life transformed before my very eyes. I became buff. Women threw themselves at me. All of my problems solved themselves. I got my dream job. I became rich. I was no longer mentally ill. And most importantly of all, I found a coffee I actually liked. It’s got just the right blend of sweet and bitter that doesn’t make me want to spit it out immediately. I love this coffee so much I make a 6oz can last 2-3 hours. Any quicker would be sacrilege. It’s a shame it costs so much money but the financial burden is worth it to me, because it’s a nice little treat in the morning which also helps curb my body’s apparent constant need for sugar (only 20% DV? Crazy!!). Don’t go for that crappy canned Starbucks you see at convenience stores, go the extra mile and get BOSS coffee, because it will change your life like it did mine. Read more | 5.0\nIf you've ever been to Japan, you've no doubt seen the Suntory brand everywhere. Traveling over there I became a fan of this, and enjoy this particular version. Not super sweet, excellent coffee taste, and for coffee in a can, IMHO you can't beat this. Starbucks and other canned coffees are distant seconds to me. Very pleased that we can get this here in the States. Amazon to the rescue! Read more | 5.0\nLet me take you back to October of 2017. I had made my first trip to the wonderful land of Japan and nestled in among the good people who live there. During my stop in Kyushu, I ran across this BOSS Rainbow Mountain Blend coffee at an AEON Mall. At the behest of my friend who I was staying with at the time, I bought some to consume on the spot. It was already chilled, and as soon as the coffee hit my taste buds, I was in for a real treat. I was sure to buy up some more to take home with me on the flight back to America. Don't let the 6 oz size fool you. These little coffees pack a wallop and the taste is phenomenal. Even though I'm not one to get cream or sugar in my coffee (as Brian Griffin says, I like mine black as sin), the combo of everything feels just right. The quality of the roast is quite solid. Consisting of slightly woody notes, with not a sign of burnt flavor, this should appease any coffee snob anywhere. I'm so glad Suntory finally came to their senses and started properly importing this stateside for our enjoyment. The price is certainly higher than your typical Starbucks brew, but this really is a unique experience, almost a rite of passage that everyone should go through, and a good taste of what the Japanese like to call quality coffee. This beverage gets my seal of approval. Even if you find the price a bit too high, I'd still consider getting one case for the novelty factor and, who knows, maybe you'll get hooked? :) Read more | 5.0\nI love these coffees a lot.  I like to buy a case to keep on hand for the days that I'm feeling sluggish or having a hard time rolling out of bed since they give more caffeine than a 20oz soda at a literal fraction of the calories.  I'd make them a part of my daily routine if not for the fact they run so expensive.  At $45 for a case of 12 it's just not viable for every day drinking. Read more | 4.0\nIn Japan, people are always on the go; which is why Japan is a country that heavily strives for convenience. Canned Coffee was invented in the 1950’s for exactly that purpose. A quick pick me up, in a can, on the go. Originally conceived by UCC, Suntory absolutely perfected RTD (Ready-To-Drink) canned Coffee in the 90’s with their BOSS brand, and with it, the signature ‘Rainbow Mountain Blend’. What separates Rainbow Mountain from the rest, is its undeniable balance, and uncompromising depth of flavor. Not too sweet, not too bitter, small can, but a sizable caffeine dose. Rainbow Mountain has been notorious coveted by aficionado’s here in the States for several reasons. For one thing, prominence of Japanese culture has been on the rise for more than a decade, which means some curiosity likely stemmed from the fantastically entertaining ‘Alien Jones’ Japanese TV spots featuring the product in Japan (which I highly recommend as a quick but satisfying internet search). Secondly, the product was incredibly difficult to get ahold of before Suntory decided to bring it over. I for one am truly delighted that Suntory graced us with this absolute gem of a product. The BOSS brand has an indelible mantra surrounding it, that embodies the work life culture in Japan. People work hard to be their absolute best, and coffee is a staple that helps empower them. Suntory has applied that ideology into making a superior coffee product that leaves the consumer feeling as though they’re ‘The Boss’.  That’s why BOSS Coffee will always be my #1. Read more | 5.0\nThis is it. The best vending machine coffee in Japan, now available in the States. This amazing little can contains such a unique and delicious blend of coffee and milk, and it cannot be overstated just how good it is. It looks nearly identical to it's Japanese packaging. This can is designed in a way so that it can be opened and enjoyed hot, as it tends to come from vending machines. This is achieved by heating water on a stove, or other appropriate containers, to a hot temperature and then placing the can in the water for 3 minutes or so. Then pop it open and enjoy! It should be noted that the water is supposed to be hot, but not boiling! This is important: Do NOT Boil this product! Remove the pan of water from the heat after it reaches a hot enough temp. All in all, if you want to try something new, I definitely recommend this product. It's a delicious drink and could easily replace your morning coffee. At 2.49 a can, it's not a horrible price either. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Vanilla Honey Latte Black Churro Cake Mocha I love to support small businesses because of the personalized service and quality ingredients. The Loco Coffee brand is a healthy energy drink that's to drink. I really like the new Churro flavor, along with the Vanilla and Mocha lattes. Give it a try; you won't be disappointed. Read more | 5.0\n180 Mgs of caffeine is spot, just the right amount to feel a buzz but not keep you awake 14 hours later when you’re trying to sleep. These are under 100 calories and taste AMAZING. Churro is my current favorite. Take a look at how many grams of sugar and calories are in your Starbucks/Dunkin order. These are a third of the calories compared their bottled drinks at the grocery store.  And my friends back me up that they taste better and smoother than their usual coffee orders. Read more | 5.0\nReally I don't understand the high reviews.  I guess they are from a lot of people that are not really coffee drinkers.  Then again this is not even a good \"candy coffee flavor\"  IT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE ANY MEXICAN CHURRO I know!  It kind of leaves an unpleasant tang on your tounge, reminiscent of sour milk.  I know none of these products in a can are made to be high quality craft coffee but they should at least taste like what they claim to be.  Better to try Sang Saigon Cinnamon Vietnamese Coffee.  This one has much better flavor. Read more | 1.0\nI love Loco Coffee Black Cold Brew with Coconut Water, and I’m honestly so sad that it’s unavailable right now! 😢 This was my go-to for a quick pre-workout in the mornings. The combination of caffeine and the hydrating coconut water was perfect for getting me energized and ready to hit the gym. The flavor is super mild, with just a hint of coconut, but not sweet at all. I would love it if the coffee flavor profile was more robust, but  I appreciate that it’s low sugar, low calorie, gluten-free, and dairy-free, which keeps my pre-workout routine clean and simple. Plus, it’s incredibly convenient for on-the-go! Fingers crossed it’s restocked soon! Read more | 4.0\nI found this product while looking for an easy way to drink coffee while driving to work in the morning. I love cold brew coffee but don't always have time to stop and get one on the way to work, so I wanted to have some I could purchase and keep at home. I think these are delicious and I love that they are dairy free and not too high in sugar. I also use these as the base for my protein drinks. I definitely recommend if you are looking for pre-made dairy free cold brew coffee. Read more | 5.0\nThis coffee is delicious and well-worth the money.  I bought it to bring to work to replace the DD iced coffees that I was starting to buy every day.  These aren’t cheap but at least half the price of an iced coffee out, so I think it was a good trade.  I like that these coffees are dairy free and not overly sugary.  I didn’t notice how high the caffeine content was until they arrived at my house (180mg per can).  I enjoy my caffeine but that’s a little more than I like to consume for my afternoon coffee, so I could only drink half at a time to avoid overdosing on caffeine for the day.  Not a problem with the coffee, but higher than most canned coffees so something to be aware of. Read more | 5.0\nWhen you open the can, it smells promising. The cinnamon taste is a lot. I wasn’t really expecting that from the flavor I chose. It’s fine Read more | 2.0\nI am not a big fan of the flavor. This is one of those that has a texture issue for me. I drink a few of them, but now I can’t stomach it. I had to move onto something else. Read more | 3.0",

    "reviews": "Sweet Cream Dark Cocoa Sweet Cream Black Unsweetened 2 Flavor Variety Pack Vanilla Sweet Cream I had never tried this before so I decided on a whim to add it to my cart. It’s delicious. It’s pricey though. I would honestly recommend sticking with the less costly coffee that you love. This was good for something different & to have as a treat, though! Read more | 5.0\nThis is the greatest substitute for coffee in the morning.  When I got off coffee, I tried a lot of things and this made the grade. Read more | 5.0\nI will be the first to admit, these things taste great but are simply too expensive. I continue to drink them because I am hooked, and I really enjoy the convenience of being able to grab a quick nitro cold brew as I head out to work, but if they get much more expensive I just won't be able to justify it anymore. I will say that I have tried many other canned brands, and as far as nitro goes, I still prefer Starbucks over the others, which is odd as I am not at all a Starbucks fan. For those who drink the nitro cold brews served at Starbucks stores, these do not taste the same and generally will not have as good of a foamy head (at least not straight from the can). There are tons of tips on how to create the best drinking experience for these, and I am sure the other reviews will do it more justice than I can, so please make sure to check those as well. Read more | 5.0\nReally good. Just wish it was not as expensive. Still cheaper than going to a brick and mortar though! Read more | 4.0\nI wish these weren’t so pricey or I would order and drink them every single day! The nitro makes the coffee so smooth and creamy. You really don’t need much coffee creamer. I am in love with these drinks!! Read more | 5.0\nGreat for grab and go in the morning and the flavor is better than ordinary black coffee. If you let it sit for over an hour the flavor starts to flatten out so drink it while it’s freshly opened! Read more | 5.0\nThis is a tasty coffee which I like to enjoy when I need a little caffeine boost. While I enjoy the taste and convenience of this product there are a couple of drawbacks which are quite severe. First, these cans are pretty small, being a little less than 10 oz. Most soda cans are 12 oz. This doesn't seem like a big difference but I can sip on a soda for half and hour and be finished with a can of this in under 10 minutes. Obviously this beverage isn't carbonated but it is still unfortunate to have so little to drink. Second, as some others have mentioned, is the price. These cans individually are between $4-6 each depending on the current Amazon price. For this price I could purchase a large size coffee at the coffee shop for less money which would be similarly caffeinating and satisfying. So while I enjoy this product, it is a small serving for a high price. It is good quality and tastes nice but you are really paying for convenience here. Read more | 3.0\nI been going to Starbucks for this drink for a few years and enjoying it. When I found these I was very happy. Now I'm able to have my coffee whenever I want without having to run out several times a day and any time of day or night Read more | 5.0\n4.0\n2.0",

    "reviews": "Strawberry Cookies and Cream Chocolate I have always liked Yoohoo as a kid. Growing up I would get a couple bottles whenever me and my family traveled. Now that I am the adult doing all the traveling, I don't always have time or room for a whole bottle. These are perfect \"treats\" to satisfy a sweet tooth or for a quick snack on the way to work. Due to their size, they fit well in lunchboxes. I kept a 12v mini fridge full of them on my last trip.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Mocha Combo Pack - Vanilla & Mocha Day 2 of drinking this coffee. I've got a lot to say about it. First, if you like hints of dark chocolate and a slightly more bitter taste to your coffee, this is for you! It tastes like a rich dark chocolate mocha. Second, it's creamy. I love the creamiest of it. Third, its organic. My task of finding a coffee thats is canned and also organic AND tastes good AND has lottle sugar...well it wasn't an easy task to find. Until i stumbled across these! I also appreciate that it has less than 200mg of caffeine. It's so hard to find a coffee product that's not overly caffeinated. Third, it's very convenient. You can take this coffee with you on the go. It requires no prep. I love that. I roll out of bed early morning and stumble over to the fridge, and all I gotta do is open a can of delicious coffee to get my morning fix. Yum. The only downside? It's frigging expensive and doesn't come with very many cans. For that reason, I will not be buying it again.  If it came with a dozen cans, yes I would buy it again. But I think it only comes with 6...or maybe 8? Which us si pricy for the small quantity. Read more | 5.0\nI love Waiakea water bottles. I really was excited for this coffee drink when I found out about it last month. I'm from Hawaii, born and raised. Always supporting my locals. This drink sucks. Its like coffee and cacao. Really guys? Did you test taste before marketing? I don't need the disgustingly sweet Starbucks glass frap drink either.  But this is not it folks. So saddened to have to write this review. $30+ bucks for 8 drinks. They may make it rich tho b/c products \"from Hawaii\" have that added bonus to them. Good canned coffees: La Cololmbe, UCC Hawaii Kona, Lavazza, Illy, High Brew... etc. Read more | 1.0\nThe absolute best ready to drink coffee, and it isnt overwhelmingly sweet like others. I like that it comes in a can so no microplastics. Nice ingredients, cane sugar, it is awesome. Read more | 5.0\nThis product advertises having much less sugar than other coffee drinks and it is very obvious. The drinks are in no means bad, but if you are someone who likes a lot of sugar or syrup in your drinks a different brand might be better for you. Read more | 4.0\nI have only tried a couple of brands of cold-brewed lattes but these are out of this world. You can tell the difference very easily from the others. One of the things I like the most after the taste is they are less sweet. I was drinking them every day which you can imagine got quite expensive. I've since changed to the Colombe brand which is half the cost. I did have to adjust the sweetness but I spend less on two cases of these a month than for two weeks worth of Waiakea brand. I will sneak a few back in on occasion but it's a lot of money to commit to when you drink one a day. Read more | 5.0\n. Read more | 3.0\nThis coffee combo is by far the best tasting out of all of them, and seems to be much better price per ounce. Ingredients are simple to the point where you could probably mimic the recipe. That is a win to me. I just need to keep some hidden at work otherwise my stockpile will be gone in a day! Read more | 5.0\nI bought an 8 pack.  The first two both had solidified chunks inside where I had to spit out the drink.  I got them early December, and I just looked and they are set to expire next month.  Don't buy this stuff- it has been sitting in a warehouse for who knows how long. Read more | 1.0",

    "reviews": "Dessert Variety Dark Roast Variety Coffee and Cocoa Variety Coffee Lovers Variety Chocolate Overload Variety Assorted Tea Sampler Assorted Flavored Variety Mega Coffee Variety Light Roast Variety Ice Cream Variety Fall Flavors Decaf Variety Decaf Flavored Coffee Chocolate Coffee Variety Bold Roast Variety Assorted Hot Cocoa Medium Roast Variety Assorted Flavored Coffee I purchased the largest boxes of two different brands of \"assorted flavors\" coffee pods on the same day earlier this month. I received the other brand the day before this brand and therefore stocked my empty pod drawer with the other brand and began using it. I found it very acceptable for the price and gave it a 4 star review. As spaces emptied in my pod drawer, I replaced with this brand. WOW, what a difference!! So much better! The first one I tried was Maple Walnut and the aroma was just like Maple Syrup. I took a different one to work and when I brewed it, I got many comments of how good my coffee smelled. And these flavors taste good too. I just gave myself a blind test while writing this review. I brewed one of these pods without looking at it. This time I can't say that I could smell much of anything discernible. I tasted it and the only thing that came to mind were notes of chocolate. Sure enough, it was called Oh Fudge. When you drink these coffees, you won't be able to discern flavors as well as you would with, let's say, ice cream. But these coffees do taste very good. They are enjoyable and fun. I got the 100 box and don't have time to catalogue the flavors but I can tell you that the variety is huge and unique. I don't recommend brewing 10-12 oz. If you want a richer coffee, brew 8 oz and if you want stronger, do 6 oz. For myself, I sometimes make 10 or more oz when I purposely want a weaker cup on days of multiple cups. BTW, I did compare strengths on both brands and they were about the same. The main difference is taste and aroma. These are superior to the other. And they should be as they cost $15 more for essentially the same quantity. Bottom line, I would buy again unless I find myself penny pinching and in that case would still buy the other brand. An FYI Update: I found a pod in this box with the label Mystery and a big question mark. I brewed it and it smelled of mint. Tasted it and it tasted minty.  Not a combination I would put together with coffee but it was good. I added cream, ice, and sugar and used it to blend myself an iced Frappuccino. The mint made it even more refreshing. BOLD and DARK ROAST 40 pods If your morning requires a really rich, strong Cup of Joe, you need to try these. Since the flavored collection was so good, I thought I'd try these to have some regular pods on hand. It contained 10 different bold and darks, no flavored. These coffees are really strong! Warning: some are extra caffeinated as well. You do not have to fear watered down coffee if you brew 10 or 12 ounces. I brewed 10 oz with some half&half cream and it was still a bit on the strong side for me. For comparison, the same amount of cream that I normally use made a much darker coffee with these pods. And stronger. I cannot reiterate that enough. I enjoy this coffee instead with one part coffee and one part steamed frothy milk. Pods won't usually stand up to that combination but these do. Read more | 5.0\nGood value, great selection for the office, with so many different taste preferences, this was definitely a better value. Works great with the kurig,  great design, and fit. The pod are pretty strong, and haven't busted open.... yet. (Seriously, what do these people do with the pods? You put it in, you shut it, you push the button, it brews. End. Of . Story. How??! How does it end up all over??!!) Thank fully these pods are respectful and don't their job, no fuss. Read more | 5.0\nI gave this assorted variety pack of flavored coffee pods as a gift, and it was a big hit. The packaging was simple yet appealing, with each pod neatly arranged in a sturdy box. The recipient was excited to see the assortment of flavors, and the variety offered something for every coffee preference. The pods were compatible with Keurig K-Cup brewers, making them easy to use, and the quality of the coffee was immediately noticeable. The flavors were rich and flavorful without being overpowering, offering a great balance between boldness and sweetness. After trying a few different flavors, the recipient was pleased with how well each one brewed. The coffee was smooth and aromatic, and each flavor offered a unique twist on the typical coffee experience. The variety pack was perfect for someone who enjoys experimenting with different coffee tastes. Whether it was a morning pick-me-up or an afternoon treat, the flavored coffees provided a fun way to enjoy a cup of coffee without needing to visit a café. However, there were a couple of minor issues. First, some of the flavors were a bit sweeter than expected, which might not appeal to those who prefer a more traditional coffee taste. A simple solution would be to try brewing on a smaller cup setting to tone down the sweetness. Additionally, while the variety was great, the pack didn’t include as many of some flavors as others, meaning some favorites ran out quicker. Despite these small concerns, it made for a thoughtful and enjoyable gift that provided plenty of delicious coffee moments. Read more | 4.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n4.0",

    "reviews": "1 Count (Pack of 96) 48 Count (Pack of 1) Attention all caffeine warriors and java commandos – the Black Rifle Coffee Supply Drop has officially become the arsenal for my daily battle against the forces of sleep! This variety pack is like a tactical strike against morning grogginess, and it's armed with enough flavor firepower to make your taste buds salute. First off, let's talk about the names – Silencer Smooth, AK Espresso, Just Black, and Beyond Black. It's like they're naming elite special ops squads for my taste buds. I feel like I should be sipping these blends while wearing camouflage pajamas and reciting military code. Silencer Smooth: This coffee glides down smoother than a stealth bomber in the night sky. It's so velvety that I half expected James Bond to pop out of my mug, asking if I needed a side mission with my caffeine fix. AK Espresso: If coffee were ammunition, AK Espresso would be the high-powered round that kicks you straight into wakefulness. I took a sip and suddenly felt like I could bench press a tank. Move over, espresso shots – this is the real deal. Just Black: This is the coffee for purists, the black-ops operatives of the caffeine world. It's so bold and unapologetic that I'm convinced it could wake the dead. Forget sugar and cream – Just Black is a lone wolf on a mission. Beyond Black: If Just Black is a lone wolf, Beyond Black is the entire wolfpack. This coffee is so intense; I feel like I've been slapped awake by a grizzly bear. It's the jet fuel my morning needs to take off and conquer the day. The only downside? My coffee machine is starting to feel like a military base. I catch it saluting every time I load a Black Rifle pod. It's like my Keurig has gone full GI Joe. In conclusion, the Black Rifle Coffee Supply Drop is a coffee connoisseur's dream and a sleep-deprived warrior's best friend. These blends are more than just coffee; they're the ammunition you need to face the day's challenges head-on. 10/10, would recommend for a caffeinated journey that's more epic than an action movie marathon!

Read more | 5.0\nGetting protein is hard, and as we age AARP and doctors say we need even more protein. UT Southwestern Emergency Room Hospital's Dietician said my 160 pound, 80-year-old mom needs 68g of protein daily when bedridden and AARP recommends as much as 90g of protein a day when she is able to get around. Ensure MAX Protein drinks have been a savior with just 150 calories, 25 vitamins & minerals and 30g of protein! Trying to get 90g of protein a day into a person who eats like a bird is nearly impossible without this product!! To determine which flavor(s) she/I liked, we bought different 4 packs and did taste tests. Once we worked out that the best flavor to us unrefrigerated was strawberry, I began ordering them with auto-ship through Amazon for the convenience of arriving on my doorstep without having to track quantities. This also saved me from the headache of the local retail stores all having empty shelves of the good flavors! We have found over time that serving them chilled does improve the flavor. I prefer strawberry flavor if room temperature or refrigerated, while she wants some variety, so I've expanded to offer refrigerated strawberry, milk chocolate and French vanilla. Refrigerated she prefers milk chocolate and unrefrigerated she prefers strawberry. However, she does not want to drink the same flavor every day, so I keep a 'Neapolitan' of flavors in our fridge door for her: creamy strawberry, French vanilla and milk chocolate. Not getting enough protein does have health consequences. I kept trying to tell her eating like she was and only drinking one Ensure MAX Protein a day was not enough protein. She needed/needs 2 a day. Despite 2x weekly physical therapy for 2 hours, she kept getting weaker. Finally, her physical therapist asked if she was getting enough protein because she kept getting weaker. Please learn from our mistake and be sure to get enough protein. It is extra hard to have to make up for the loss of muscle that happens from trying to build strength but not having the proper fuel in your body. I feel very badly for my mom, and 'I told you so' is not satisfying as now I watch her struggle with extra weakness. THIS IS A LIFE CHANGER PRODUCT!! Also love that it is only 150 calories, so it isn't packing on the pounds at the same time as providing protein. HIGHLY RECOMMEND CREAMY STRAWBERRY ENSURE MAX PROTEIN!! I hope this review helps someone else. Read more | 5.0\nPersonally the easiest way for me to get 30g of protein. I've bought this many times on Amazon and the quality has always been consistent for me. No complaints about the taste. Read more | 5.0\nI started with another brand, but after being shorted on my order and the seller not making good on promises to provide a new order, I decided to switch to a different brand. I also wanted to try vanilla and couldn't seem to find it in the other brand. I was able to order French Vanilla and Chocolate in the Ensure, but I couldn't find the Creamy Peach that is supposed to be a new flavor. This is a comparison. The other product I ordered was Premier Protein. It's a quality product, but cost me nearly 23 cents an ounce. It was thick and creamy and very tasty. The thicker fluid seemed more shake-like, but I didn't find that particularly important. The Ensure can be partially frozen to be more shake-like if the thickness is important to you. To me there is a slight, but not unpleasant aftertaste and tongue coating in all protein drinks. The tongue coating is similar to what happens after drinking a glass of milk. I could only order chocolate in the Premier Protein, so I can't compare the vanilla to vanilla, but the chocolates were both fine. Because of the thinner consistency, the Ensure reminded me a bit of a Yahoo drink, but it's not as sweet. As I said, the Ensure is thinner, but both flavors are equally good in taste. Both brands are 11 fluid oz, 30g protein. Premier has 24 vitamins and minerals while Ensure has 25. Both had 1 g sugar. The difference: After trying to research Ensure prior to ordering, I found out after the fact, there is corn fiber in it. Corn syrup can give me a lot of joint pain, especially in my hips. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that the corn fiber will not have the same effect. If it does, I will update my review. The Ensure was 19 cents per fluid ounce, but while I was figuring out what I would say in this review, the price increased by $1.32 per box of 12, right in front of my eyes. So, at this point, Ensure will cost you 20 cents per fluid oz. So, at this point, there is a difference of about 33 cents per container. That may not seem like much, but over a year of use, it adds up to anyone that may be on a very tight budget. The Ensure comes in smaller boxes of 12. The Premier I ordered was sold as a box of 18, but it was only 15. I ordered a box of 12 Ensure that came with 3 packs of 4, packaged as they would be on a store shelf. The 4 packs were in a very sturdy box and the boxes inside another box. It's a good thing they were well packed, as the outside box had received some abuse. My product was fine. I ordered the Ensure Friday afternoon and by late Saturday afternoon, I had the product instead of waiting nearly 2 weeks as I did from the other seller of the Premier Protein. As I said, the price is better for the Ensure, I found the taste very similar. There is very little different in the nutritional components and the seller/delivery was superior. The two differences are the thickness and that Ensure does have corn fiber. If you need extra protein in your diet, or get busy and forget about lunch etc. like I do, I think you will appreciate the convenience of these drinks. Read more | 4.0\nLike it very much. Taste good  and  great protein. Read more | 5.0\nI love the French vanilla. I started drinking it because I felt like I wasn’t getting as much protein and nutrition as I needed - now that I’m older. I bought the first box skeptically but now I take it to work and drink at least one a day. I love it and feel I like it has a good amount of vitamins minerals and protein without a ton of sugar- I don’t want to raise my A1c and become diabetic! I recommend it fir active people that are seniors! Read more | 5.0\nRecomendable totalmente | 5.0",

If you're expecting Pike Place Roast, the taste of this cold brew could potentially be off-putting. But honestly it's this kind of flavor which is indicative of high-quality coffee.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Natural Variety Sampler Latte Love Autumn Spice Sampler Pack I’ve tried a lot of protein coffee powders, but this one really stands out. The taste is excellent—smooth, rich, and without any weird aftertaste. It blends effortlessly, no clumps or grittiness, making it super easy to mix into my morning routine. The chai flavor is especially impressive—it actually tastes like a real dirty chai from a coffee shop. If you’re looking for a protein boost without sacrificing flavor, this is definitely worth trying! Would highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThese actually taste pretty good and I didn’t have high expectations for protein coffee. Some taste more protein-ish than others so here’s my take on the flavors (I had all of them iced) Carmel: carmel is normally one of my go to flavors for coffee so I was excited for this one but I actually think it ranks as my least favorite because it had the strongest  protein after taste Mocha: same thing for mocha, I normally love it but this one had a fairly strong protein after taste Vanilla: I normally hate vanilla coffee but I actually really liked this one. It did not have a protein after taste and was very smooth Original: ended up being one of my favorites. It has a really good flavor and not too strong of an aftertaste. I expected to like it, but didn’t think it would be one of my favs so I was pleasantly surprised Chocolate peanut butter : definitely my favorite and I ended up ordering a big bag of it. Very good and smooth with very little protein taste to it. It tastes like you’re drinking a Reese cup but not too sweet Cinnamon: not terrible as far as an aftertaste goes, but I don’t personally love cinnamon so it just wasn’t for me Overall I think Chike has a great flavor and does a good job about masking the protein. I look forward to drinking these every morning. Although I’m not too sure about the two shots of espresso because I never feel super energized afterwards. Either way I think they’re a great after workout drink to fill you up and get a little caffeine in. They’re easy to shake and take on the go which is also what I love about them. I also don’t think it’s too ridiculously priced compared to most protein products. One thing I did with some of them is I ended up getting the torani sugar free syrups to add a little more flavor. I combined the original with torani sugar free pumpkin and it was very good. Read more | 5.0\nThese tasted really good. I felt very energized! I was not a fan of the clumpy caramel or the overly powerful cinnamon. The caramel didn't mix well and seemed to have almost no caramel to it. The cinnamon was basically 50/50 grainy cinnamon. The rest tasted like what they were supposed to and had a pleasant flavor. Read more | 5.0\nPros: Very convenient for travel. I love that each packet is a serving. Lets you try all of the flavors, unlike every other protein shake coffee mix I looked at, which are all very expensive for large bags. All of the flavors are sweet and smooth when blended wit ice and nonfat lactose free mik (how I tried them). Each packet has a lot of caffeine - I felt more awake after this then after my usual 2 cups of coffee. The vanilla flavor won for best tasting. The peanut butter chocolate flavor also tasted good without bitterness, BUT it reminded me too much of a PB-C protein bar and was too sweet for me. Cons: Too sweet for my husband who likes his coffee black. Even the original flavor tasted more like a latte, even when made with water. Some of the flavors had a bitter after-taste - the original/plain packet would have been my favorite if not for the aftertaste. The mocha flavor was not chocolatey and I did not like it. The caramel flavor was surprisingly the worst because I could taste the protein powder throughout, despite making it smooth in a Ninja blender, and I could not finish it. I was surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI tried the caramel iced coffee and it was so delicious I immediately ordered the multi-pack to try all of the flavors!

    "reviews": "I have been drinking Deathwish for many years, and this is smooth, just isn't as smooth as the nitro cold brew from 2017, but it is pretty close, it also has the right amount of sweetness and vanilla and doesn't have an odd aftertaste like many canned coffees. I would recommend! Read more | 5.0\nDisclosure: This was sent to me for free via the Vine program. I did not receive monetary compensation to write this review, just the product itself. Picked this up because I love RTD coffee beverages. To start, I'll be honest, I didn't actually get the vanilla flavor, I got the original flavor. I was looking forward to that but by the time I noticed it was when I was sipping out of the first can and going \"Man, this isn't vanilla.\" So I'm just reviewing what I got. And what I got I loved. The stuff is a proper strong coffee and will keep you awake when you need it to. It's not bitter, far from it. It's creamy and smooth with a strong aroma of fresh roasted nuts and molasses. It'll pump you full of caffeine and taste good doing it. My only slight problem is the price. $40 for 12, or $3.33 a piece, is a pretty steep price for these. But if you can afford the goods, I highly recommend the original flavor and I'm sure the vanilla is just as good. Read more | 4.0\nI had never tried this brand of coffee before but it had been recommended to me which is why I decided to try this 12 pack of 11oz  Iced Coffee Cold Brew, Fair Trade (Vanilla Latte). The first thing that both me and my partner noticed about this product is that it reminded us exactly of the flavor of the vanilla Starbucks bottled Frappuccino, which we both actually like. I liked specifically too that it has more coffee than just one cup, as I have a high coffee tolerance.  The added protein boost is cool too. The canned form is nice to be able to just throw in your bag or backpack on the go for later. Overall, we really liked these, and at the current price of about $40 for 12 cans of tasty high caffeine protein coffee ($3.33 each) I think it's a pretty good deal overall for what you get. Since we liked them so much, they are a good deal, and taste delicious, we do recommend them to others. Read more | 5.0\nI received my order yesterday,  took product out of box and this can was damaged and leaking Read more | 1.0\nThe death wish iced coffee is delicious.  It has a similar taste to the major brand that we usually drink, but not quite as sweet. It's not as rich either which makes it seem less filling. The directions say you should shake the can before opening,  but my suggestion is to do it over the sink with a paper towel to avoid the spray. It's not nearly as bad as shaking a warm soda, but enough to take precautions.  Having some protein is a bonus. The amount of caffeine was just right for us. We like having it in a can as opposed to glass. Read more | 5.0\nTasted okay but no appreciable vanilla flavor. Shook before drinking as instructed and it spewed a little bit on opening the can. Convenient packaged cans. Shelf life about 1 year. Read more | 3.0\nDeath Wish Coffee offers some of the strongest caffinated coffee on the market right now. I've been wanting to try them for ages to replace energy drinks, and am glad that I was finslky able too! One can offers about 350mg of caffeine. This is 50mg shy of being a safe amount per day for most people. The vanilla flavor is good! It's not as sweet as I usually prefer my lattes but it's surprisingly pleasant to drink any ways. Not bitter in the slightest! I can see this becoming a regular rotation of mine - but I'll be splitting a can with my husband for sure. Highly recommend this brand & specifically the vanilla lattes - I'm a chocolate person but this is really tasty! Read more | 5.0\nI'm 90% happy with this. The vanilla flavor is there, but not quite distinct. Goes down smooth; a nice alternative to regular coffee blends. My main complaint is the note on the label to shake the can before opening can lead you to actually shake the can, which will result in pressurized coffee spurting out when you crack the can open. (Not fun while commuting.) So I'd recommend mildly rocking your can back and forth and then opening it up somewhere safe. Read more | 4.0",

That being said, the real problem is the ever fluctuating price, seems more like a bait and switch or the rain forest is jacking the prices when the stock runs low.

I used to be able to drink regular coffee but the last several years caffeine has started to give me anxiety so I can't drink a regular cup of coffee anymore for the most part. I have been buying decaf for a long time and I've tried every brand out there literally everything in the store and pretty much everything on Amazon that has a high rating. I'm not made of money so I skip the off-brands and ones that just don't have a ton of reviews. I finally made my way to this brand but I was a little hesitant because I'm not into fads and this has the mushroom stuff in it, which is all the craze right now it seems. I figured might as well try it what do I have to lose right? The first sip I took it was almost like my brain couldn't register it, like I was being tricked. I'm not joking. I took a few more sips and said to myself this is the best coffee I've ever had in my life! It's so smooth I can't even explain it you guys. There is no weird flavors of earthy mushrooms or anything like that in it it just has the smoothest taste I've ever had in a cup of coffee.

It does say it on the back of the box, which in NEVER shown in their pictures . I truly think that the amount should be shown!! I probably won’t order again.

Read more | 5.0\nThis would be my first purchase of the product.  Following the instructions of one cup water to one packet did not work for me as the water dominated the flavor.  Two packets per one cup water was a better flavor though still abit weak. To be fair I prefer a stronger cup of coffee which would be the same for the latte or cappuccino type drinks. The three varieties- latte, macchiato and cappuccino all required twice as much mix as called for to make a decent cup of beverage though I still thought the products tasted a bit weak. I won’t purchase this again and would not recommend it to someone. Disappointing purchase at twice the cost per cup. Read more | 1.0",

Individually, these two products are exceptional, but when used together, they create a powerful synergy that takes brain function to new heights. Let me share my experience and explain why this dynamic duo has become an integral part of my daily routine. Let's start with Four Sigmatic Think.

With a carefully selected combination of functional mushrooms and adaptogenic herbs, Think is designed to support cognitive function, memory, and focus.

The unique blend of lion's mane mushroom, rhodiola, and chaga works synergistically to enhance cognitive abilities without any jitters or crashes. I feel a sustained and smooth mental uplift that lasts throughout the day, allowing me to stay productive and engaged in demanding tasks.

The combination of Four Sigmatic Think and Super Cocoa amplifies the cognitive benefits of each product. The lion's mane mushroom and other nootropics in Think enhance memory and focus, while the natural compounds in cocoa promote mood and overall well-being. I have experienced improved mental clarity, heightened creativity, and enhanced productivity since incorporating this dynamic duo into my daily routine. Another aspect that makes this combination truly outstanding is the versatility it offers. I enjoy experimenting with different ratios of Think and Super Cocoa to create my perfect brain-boosting mocha.

Together, they create a harmonious symphony of mental clarity, focus, and overall cognitive enhancement. Indulge your senses and fuel your mind with this exceptional combination. Read more | 5.0\nI've been a fan of Mushroom Coffee for 8 years now and have tried almost everything out there. I have learned 4 very important things to look out for when choosing the best mushroom coffee: 1.  Taste 2.  Dosage 3.  Quality 4.  Value Here’s the breakdown of my thoughts on Four Sigmatic Ground Coffee: 1) TASTE: Overall taste is excellent - the beans are roasted nicely, and the flavor is smooth with a hint of chocolate notes, so I’m very happy with the taste. 2) DOSAGE: This part is extremely important, because if you’re going to incorporate functional mushrooms into your routine you need to know how much of each mushroom you are putting in your body and this can be the hardest information to derive from many brands. In doing my own research I’ve found that you want at least 500mg of one strain to see any benefits. Four Sigmatic only uses 2 mushrooms, Lion’s Mane and Chaga. However, the dosage amount is not stated anywhere on the packaging, and because it’s just coffee beans, I can’t even begin to guess. It could be fractions of what a normal dose should be. 3) QUALITY: Four Sigmatic uses 100% fruiting bodies, which is the purest form of mushroom extract and what I look for in my mushroom coffee. 4) VALUE: The quality seems good, but there is no clear statement on the dosage of mushroom extract per serving which makes the value very low for me. Right now, I use Lucid as my main morning routine coffee and Four Sigmatic on my downtime as maintenance. Four sigmatic makes me feel good, however I feel much more effects with Lucid because 1) It delivers a much higher dose of 4 mushrooms at 2,000mg total 2) It has a nootropic stack (fuel for your brain) 3) It uses 100% fruiting body mushroom extract (the highest quality possible). Plus, it tastes great. Four sigmatic will stay in my rotation for chill days because it’s cheap, but I turn to Lucid when I need to operate at peak performance. Remember to keep these tips in mind and always read the label! Read more | 5.0\nI have been using Four Sigmatic Focus Mushroom Coffee for about four months now, and I am beyond impressed! As someone who loves coffee but also values mental clarity and focus, this blend is a game-changer.  To extend its use, I add this to my regular coffee.  This gives me the flavor I want while still being effective. Smooth and Rich Coffee Flavor: The coffee has a rich, smooth flavor that’s not overly bitter, making it a pleasure to drink. Even though it’s infused with Lion's Mane and Chaga mushrooms, there’s no earthy or “mushroomy” taste—just a great, well-balanced cup of coffee. Enhanced Focus and Clarity: What really sets this coffee apart is its ability to boost focus without the jitters. I’ve noticed that after drinking it, I feel mentally sharp and more productive throughout the day. The Lion’s Mane mushroom is known for its cognitive-enhancing properties, and I definitely feel the difference when it comes to staying focused on tasks. Supports Immunity: I also love the added benefits of immune support from Chaga mushrooms, which have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. This is great for my arthritis, plus, it’s nice to know that I’m drinking something that not only helps me stay alert but also supports my overall health. Perfect for a Morning Boost: This coffee is an excellent way to start the day. It gives me a natural energy boost without the crash that comes with some other coffees. It also keeps me feeling energized and clear-headed, making it ideal for work or study. Organic and Clean Ingredients: I really appreciate that this coffee is made with organic ingredients, so I feel good about what I’m putting into my body.

    "reviews": "If you’re an East Coast Sheetz fan, you probably felt personally attacked when they got rid of the frozen Kona Mocha. Well, guess what? This is it. Identical taste, no road trip required. Honestly, I wish I had discovered this sooner—it’s ridiculously low-cost per serving, which means I can now feed my addiction without breaking the bank. It’s perfect for lazy days when I just want iced coffee, but the real magic happens when I bust out the blender for that frozen, creamy goodness. The measurements are spot-on, so there’s zero guesswork—just pure mocha joy every time. The only downside? The smaller bags are always sold out, probably because everyone else figured this out before I did. If you’ve been mourning the loss of Sheetz’s Kona Mocha, consider this your official sign to stock up. You’ll thank me later! Read more | 5.0\nPumpkin spice iced drink mix was the bomb.

There is a lot of sugar in in, but it's perfect for an occasional pick me up! This will last you a while, so it's a great value! Read more | 5.0\nI've never been much of a coffee drinker but I would occasionally purchase a frozen frappucino from various places (Starbucks, McDonalds, etc). Then one day I had a frozen Kona Mocha at Sheetz and I was instantly hooked. It had such a distinct, unique flavor that was unlike any of the others out there and I couldn't get enough. The only problem was the price. If you buy one at Sheetz, you'll end up spending over $4 for one (and theirs are small compared to other places). When I went online looking for a recipe on how to make one at home, to save a little money, I stumbled upon this stuff from Big Train. I decided to give it a try because all the ingredients matched up to Sheetz's online ingredients list. Well, let me tell you, they match up for a reason - it's EXACTLY the same. I couldn't believe it. I knew it was the second I opened it because it smelled the same. All you do is blend the powder, ice (I add just a little more than the bag says to, to make it slightly thicker) and milk (I always got almond milk at Sheetz, so that's what I use at home) and it's done. It's fine just the way that is, but because I've been adding caramel every time I buy one at Sheetz, I also add a tablespoon and a half of caramel sauce, too (just the cheap Hershey's kind). The ones at Sheetz also come with whipped cream on top and chocolate drizzle, but that was never that important to me. The bag will make approximately 20 of the Sheetz-sized drinks, so by buying this powder from Big Train, you can easily make frozen Kona Mochas at home for AT LEAST half the price, if not less. Though, to be honest, even though I initially hoped this would help me save money by not having to buy them at Sheetz once or twice a week anymore, I have a feeling, with them being SO good, tasting exactly the same and being so easy to make, I think I might end up spending the same every week anyway, but just having them a lot more frequently now that I found this product from Big Train. I highly recommend it. It's fantastic! EDIT: I've downgraded my rating by one star, not because of the product but because of its packaging/handling. I subscribed to get monthly shipments and my first shipment (the second bag I've ordered) arrived with a nick about an inch long in the bag, causing it to leak powder in the box. Because it's something edible, I didn't take any chances and decided not to use it and got a replacement. It's supposed to arrive in a couple days. I noticed a couple other people have experienced the same issue. I hope this was just a one time thing and I won't experience it again. I'll post again about its condition when my replacement comes. To be continued... UPDATE: My third bag (replacement for second that was damaged) arrived and it was fine. There WAS a small opening in the bottom seam of the bag (probably less than a quarter of an inch), but it was very small (a tiny bit of powder came out only after I lifted it up; there wasn't any in the box itself) and it appeared to just be a natural opening, from the weight/pressure of the powder. When I opened the bag all the way along that same side, the seam appeared to have been sealed all the way across (the grooves were all the way across on both sides), it just naturally opened slightly. The bags are filled with a lot of powder (3.5 pounds is a lot heavier than you'd think) and it must have just caused the seal to break during packing or shipment (or even when I lifted the bag up?). I've been enjoying it since it arrived and it tastes fine (and hasn't made me sick or any thing). I still feel like I need to examine each bag that arrives, but hopefully the bad experiences in the future (if any) will outweigh the good ones. I still highly recommend this product. It's fantastic. I also recommend dividing the powder up when you get it and put each portion in baggies to make it easier when getting ready to blend one up. UPDATE #2: My second monthly shipment arrived today in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings. UPDATE #3: I ran out of my second monthly bag before my third (I'm getting another family member hooked on this delicious stuff) so I ordered an extra one. It came in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings. I'll update again when my third monthly shipment arrives in a couple weeks. UPDATE #4: My third monthly shipment arrived today in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings. UPDATE #5: My fourth monthly shipment arrived today. It was the first time it was shipped in a bubble envelope as opposed to a box, which made me really nervous. LUCKILY, I opened it and the bag was in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings, but if they are going to be sending them like this from now on, I'm more concerned than before that something might happen. Hopefully nothing will. Also, if you're unsure whether your bag has an opening anywhere in it or not, believe me, you'll know the second you open the box or envelope, not because you'll necessarily see some of the powder in the box or a noticeable hole in the bag but because the Kona Mocha has such a strong, distinctive smell, you'll smell it right away. So, use your nose as a test, too. If you don't smell anything, it's probably sealed and safe. UPDATE #6: My fifth monthly shipment arrived today in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings. This one arrived in a box with bubble wrap for protection (much better than the bubble envelope they used previously). Also, I had ordered an extra bag a little over two weeks ago and it arrived (even with a couple other things in the box) in perfect condition as well. Since I haven't had any issues in a while, I've been happy with my purchases every time since those minor issues happened, and I don't want this review to reach some length limit, I will leave this as it is and only update it from now on when or if an issue ever arises again. Thanks for taking the time to read this review and I hope it helped you decide to purchase some of this great Kona Mocha coffee drink mix. I still highly recommend it. Read more | 4.0\nIt's a nice drink mix, it has a nice light cocoa flavor with a hint of spice.  You add more or less mix to get the taste that works for you.  I use 4 level spoons myself in hot water.  Great for helping warm up on chilly days.  I drink it year round but more on cooler days.  It's not coffee and it's not tea tea, it's its on thing.  I was introduced to it by a friend about 5 years ago and I'm glad they did.  I enjoy it, obviously. Read more | 5.0\nWith how prices are right now, I can’t afford to spend 8 dollars every other day on a Starbucks chai with extra caramel drizzle. So I bought this so I could just make it at home. The price is a bit high, but for the amount you get it can still last you for a long while depending on how often you drink the stuff! The taste is delicious on its own and with the added syrups I put in it, it tastes better than the drinks I get from Starbucks! You only really need one scoop I bought this in January and I still have more than enough even though it’s been a couple of months! Granted I only drink this a couple times a week, but it still surprises me how long this can keep you going! Will definitely order again along with other flavors they have Read more | 5.0\nI love it! A lot of reviews say it’s too sweet, but I disagree. I’m the kind of person to add some sugar to my tea, and the sweetness of this is perfect. However per the ingredients it IS mostly sugar. The taste isn’t super strong on the chai, but it tastes like what you would get at dunkin or Dutch bros, which is great! Definitely recommend, but be aware of the amount of sugar in this. Read more | 5.0\nThe Spiced Chai is amazing, but there is so much sugar. Using the recommended amount has an amazing flavor but by the end of the cup my stomach hurts from all the sugar. If I use less of the mix, the flavor isn't strong enough and the drink tastes watered down. I would love to see a low-sugar version EDIT: I ordered the \"No Sugar Added\" Vanilla Chai and it clumps like dollar store hot chocolate mix. No idea why it's so bad with clumping as the \"normal\" chai I purchased before had no clumping at all. I have to stir it with a fork for a solid 60+ seconds to get the chunks to mostly break up.

Bad tour guides.. Flavor is ok, taste a little of the dark caramel compared to mocha there is no mocha flavor but more like ginseng and guarana. The white chocolate has a more neutral flavor and the white chocolate flavor is barely there but ok. I still prefer the mocha even though I don’t taste the mocha. Back on the caramel flavor, I set it up for subscribe and save. And just today they jacked the price of $45 and change. Caramel version is in no way anywhere near worth that price and if the other flavors get price jacked as well then I will retaliate and switch over to monster or even victor allens. Caned caffein.

    "reviews": "I only do esspresso shots with a little bit of sweetness like adding condensed milk. Sometimes some soy but minimal like a traditional macchiato. I like my coffee on a more smooth, sweet taste and this hits the spot. I found this thru a subscription, and was happy finding this on here to buy. 2lbs seems like a lot but it’s worth it if you enjoy this coffee. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the Bark at the Moon dark roast coffee whole beans and was looking forward to as they describe - The rich flavors of dark chocolate and caramel drizzle coupled with a caramel-like aftertaste. This blend is the outdoor lover's dark roast. It captures the spirit of adventure with the fresh taste of the wild keeping you barking until the moon rises. Unfortunately, I can't do a review on that blend because I'm pretty sure that I received the other blend called Hell Yeah, medium roast beans. (See pictures of Front labels) Besides not tasting like the Bark at the Moon description, or looking like dark roast, the labels on the front of the bag represent the Hell Yeah blend. However, the label on the back indicates the Bark at the Moon blend (See picture). So, I will go ahead and review the Hell Yeah - medium roast that the product description states that it Tastes Like Swiss Chocolate, Macadamia Nut, Sweet, since I'm pretty sure that's what I got. Opening the bag for the first time, I got a good whiff of some nice smelling beans. Grinding them produced more pleasing smells. The first taste after brewing presented a nutty, smooth, full flavor taste. Didn't really detect a Swiss Chocolate flavor, although there were some undertones of another flavor but DEFINITELY NOT Dark Chocolate or Caramel as what was supposed to be in the coffee I ordered. It was VERY good tasting coffee, just not what I ordered. Will I order this again? Probably not, and as much as I would've LOVED to get the Bark at the Moon, I probably won't take a chance trying to order again and hope I get it the next time. Read more | 4.0\nIt smells so good when you grind it  and has a chocolate smell mixed with the smell of really good coffee. And it is really good. It's the kind of coffee that when you start drinking it like you normally would, maybe two or three good sips then set it down for a minute, you keep drinking it instead. before you know it there is none left in the cup. That's pretty much how it happened for me, and yeah it's really good coffee. But it's also 40 dollars which cost it a star. Read more | 5.0\nThe ultimate example of how much I enjoyed Drink Coffee Do Stuff's Bark at the Moon blend was two weeks ago when I had to wake up at 5am to be ready to register my daughter for pre-school next year...the program we are using opens their online registration very early and you want to be first in line to get everything submitted/completed as that can have some impact on if your kid gets into the program. This is usually not a pleasant experience as it entails typing endless pages of contact information, medical details and academic goals...but....I actually looked forward to rolling out of bed because I knew I had a pot of Bark at the Moon ready to go! The bag I got said it was roasted on 2/15 and I received several days after that...so this is some of the freshest coffee I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I thought that was really cool. I'm a fan of darker blends of coffee and Bark at the Moon certainly fits that category. The description professes it to have notes of dark chocolate, Carmel drizzle and be very rich...I for sure agree with the last two..the dark chocolate doesn't really come out for me that I can notice. I have actually also tried the \"Hell Yeah\" blend from this same company and you can very much taste a difference between the medium-ness of that and the darkness of the Bark at the Moon. The packaging the beans came in seemed high quality and let me rubber band it back up in between grinding beans. I use a Bodum burr grinder and the beans come out really nicely ground up/fine for my drip coffee maker (Technavorm Mochamaster). This morning I have a busy day so I ground up enough for two pots. Pictured are my cats inspecting the bag and my first cup of the morning. Great product! Read more | 5.0\nI think I can taste a bit of the chocolate notes. This coffee is very light, and I'm not a huge fan of dark roast but I'm glad I got dark roast. The beans are not oily at all and smell great. The first thing I noticed was that it was acidic and sour black. So I had it with my usual milk and honey and it just lacked the other notes and depth I'm used to. I do sense the sweetness of the coffee, I think it's not as bitter as I'd imagine dark roast to be. Great mild coffee, good with milk Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "Since I started drinking DCDS coffee I have learned that coffee is meant to be enjoyed. Before I was introduced to this coffee, my morning cup was half coffee, half creamer just so I could get it down. Now DCDS is the only coffee I buy. I ordered my favorite roast, Hell Yeah (medium roast) and Bark at the Moon (dark roast) for the mornings that I need a little extra kick. I love this brands packaging. The QR code is AWESOME. It leads you to short yet very helpful videos on how to brew your coffee many different ways. Reading some reviews, they say it was “bitter”… I would argue that they are brewing it wrong. Hence the helpful How To videos. I can say that this coffee is truly smooth and easy to drink by itself. It’s the first coffee I could ever drink black and enjoy. Yes, even the dark roast! I will  for sure be ordering again!! If you’re ever in the Tahoe region, check out one of their coffee shops and order the purple haze. 10/10 recommend.

They were local (Tahoe) but she wasn’t sure how to order it. Of course Amazon has everything! This coffee is so good my husband won’t put creamer in it!! You’ll just have to try it for yourself!!

Opting for the pour-over method, I was pleasantly surprised by the smoothness and creamy texture it offered.

Whether you’re a pour-over enthusiast or exploring brewing methods, this coffee promises an enjoyable and flavorful journey. A definite recommendation for those seeking a deliciously smooth and versatile brew! Read more | 5.0\nChat GPT hold my mug, I got this one.... First off , Hell Yeah !!!

So far, I’ve received expired coffee from two sellers, the first could have been an accident and was only 30 days past expiration date - but my most recent order was for two cases from the seller AAB that were expired for more then 2.5 months - and they Literally BLACKED OUT the Expiration date on the boxes BEFORE sending it, which means they knew what they were doing. Please try the product, it is amazing and my favorite coffee ever… Just be careful who you’re ordering it from since several “off brand” sellers are sending expired coffee on purpose. I can say I’ve never received expired coffee from the manufacturer - so they’re a safe bet. Good luck! Read more | 1.0\nThis coffee is sometimes hard to find in stock, its so good.

There is a reason this drink is unanimously praised everywhere.  I hope someone finds a way to bring the price down to like 35.00 or so for 12 without huge formula changes or anything. My concern with products like these is that there is an early release version that circulates and gets people hooked, and then CEOs jump in and demand profit, which results in lower quality and a worse product over time, slowly gaslighting consumers. Keep working hard, Black Rifle, you have the leading coffee product on the market, and its puts Starbucks and everything else to shame. Read more | 4.0",

Membership fee is a waste when all it provides is mishandled products, expired products misdelivered products and crushed products. The rain forest is only gotten worse with no more hope in sight.

The minim clumps is most likely the milk content coagulating do to exposure to heat during stocking shipping or delivery shipping. Haven’t had the same issue with the double shot cans. Prefer the taste of the triple shot but the lumpy texture is annoying. Product tastes so good I drink 2 a day.

It reminds me a bit of some of the old-fashioned diner coffee from my early days.  That's not what I'm looking for now.  Maybe the fact it's a blend takes away some richness.  The name is fun but I need more from my coffee. Read more | 3.0\nWhen I opened the package, I noticed that the beans were medium roast. I didn’t mind it because I like medium roast.

    "reviews": "SANG with Oatmilk SANG Traditional SANG Saigon Cinnamon Oatmilk Latte SANG Saigon Cinnamon Latte SANG Straight Black with Vanilla I drank one of the cans this morning. It was good and had a good flavor. Good value for the money. It’s keeping me going like I hoped. Good durability. It tasted smooth. The cinnamon flavor was good. Will buy again. I don’t have caffeine jitters after drinking it. Highly recommend! Update: 24 August 2024- I just wanted to say that I drink this coffee and I really love it a lot! It’s keeping me up and going! I will be buying this again. It’s smaller cans compared to other coffees I’ve bought, but it’s just enough. I don’t want a whole lot of coffee to drink. I find other brands are too much for me. I want something to open my eyes, give me energy and keep me going all day without sucking down great big cans or bottles. This is perfect! Read more | 5.0\nI always crave a fresh iced straight black coffee each morning and Every time, it's always too bitter or sour. BUT THIS COFFEE has managed to perfect the recipe to slightly sweeten black coffee just enough to not disrupt the dark flavor!! I pop one in my backpack before school each morning and it keeps me energized throughout classes. So Convenient and Sucha Cute packaging! It also goes well with ANYTHING>> Especially with sweet snacks, and the cold coffee balances out EVERYTHING. PLS keep this COFFEE stocked :)) I'm so excited to try the other flavors!! Read more | 5.0\nIgnoring the false advertising here, the coffee itself tastes pretty good, but in my opinion it's a bit too watery and not creamy like the Vietnamese lattes I've had in local cafes.

I drink one basically every morning if I need to get up earlier or am just generally feeling tired; the caffeine in it is the perfect boost! It is super well-worth the price! Read more | 5.0\nSince it's Vietnamese Coffee, I was expecting the coffee flavor to be more intense, but to me, all I can taste is super super sweet oat milk and cinnamon. I always drink my coffee with creamer so I'm used to slightly sweet coffee, but this is way overboard and makes it undrinkable for me unless I treat it like a creamer for my cold brew coffee. Unfortunately it's not very smooth either...I don't know if it's due to the oat milk or cinnamon, but I physically feel stuff in my throat and develop a cough after I drink it.. Read more | 2.0",

You can taste the oat kill, but it’s not overpowering and goes down smooth! Read more | 5.0\nWas my favorite coffee. Realistically probably still is. But something unacceptable happened on my last two orders of the Carmel flavor Rise. I buy multiflavored packs weekly!! I spend about $350 monthly on this coffee. So I love it. I truly do. It’s an any time kind of drink. Breakfast lunch dinner meal replacement snack refresher you name it. So as a top customer without doubt I hate to say this has happened. But every can I’m popping open In the last two batches has a large k-cup like plastic receptacle  floating INSIDE the can!!!? Too big to fit entirely through the mouth piece, so manufacturing operations would know how this error was possible. Business process management should look at the cause with quality assurance floor manager in manufacturing. Cans were not tampered with or opened. They came in their plastic packages as normal.Silver Code Identifier on Can: M2DL 01CN or GTIN: G1722T112495, Barcode: 5001824954 batch number at the bottom of the can: /98605013 BB: 05 01 2024 20:34. Providing you the info so you can look to what happened. How it happened and prevent it from happening again. Because  this should not have happened at all even once, let alone more than one can!! I love your product guys. I truly do. But this was a big mistake. Initially I heard it banging around I thought it was frozen fats or something because maybe my fridge was too cold I thought to myself… “maybe that isolated from the nitro process?”. And so I drank it.  Not realizing it was actually a plastic piece of manufacturing trash inside the cup. But found out too late after having difficulty drinking. But I drank the whole thing until becoming aware it was actually plastic coffee trash in there. The trash cup reads B on one inner corner and 13 to the right of it on the following corner, on the inside. The trash cup is white and beveled edges. Which I saved after I cut it open when I couldn’t pull it out. Unacceptable manufacturing problem. Rise, as someone who pays a lot of money, I trusted your product. As image provided above you can see the stained ring inside the can left by the k cup sticking to the inside prior to it being opened,  and the batch should never have hit the shelves and been sold. You guys need to do a manufacturing review and quality assurance manager should be either retrained or replaced. These are choking hazards. They are not accounted for in your packaging. I truly hope you will make this right.  As I  hoped for more from one of my favorite companies. Read more | 1.0\nThese are delicious! I love that it's organic and tastes very clean. I usually drink my coffee black, and have reordered these in black, but i gotta say the creamy ones are a nice treat. Highly Recommended Read more | 5.0\nI am in LOVE with this coffee brand! It is so creamy and smooth, and for the mocha nitro cold brew in particular the chocolate flavor is a beautiful complement to the oat milk base. The biggest flaw is actually with either the can structure or the protective casing. I'd estimate that 1 in 3 packs I've ordered over the years has a can leaking all over the inside of the package, but it is difficult to narrow down which one because the hole is usually tiny. I've resorted to weighing the cans on a food scale to see which one is significantly lighter than the others. It's unfortunate because as I drink through the rest of them I'm always wondering \"did I miss a leaking can?\". Haven't gotten ill yet so that's something! Read more | 3.0",

    "reviews": "Skinny Coffee Immunity Coffee Dark Roast Coffee Collagen Coffee Mushrooms Coffee Ok, what's important?  First if your looking for a coffee replacement because normal coffee is acidic and caffinated and affects your stomach, you are on the right path.  I have had gerds until I removed caffeine.  I used a decaffeinated coffee and it helped, only issue was acids were still there. Step in a mushroom blend with coffee flavor and minimal caffeine and no acidic bitterness.  This brand checked all the right boxes.  It breaks down very well once hot water is poured over it.  I use 2 tsp in 16 ounces of hot water, add a touch of a flavored creamer by choice and it's great.  The coffee flavor for me is just right at that 2 tsp amount.  The mushroom flavor is earthy and a little nutty. Does not over power the coffee flavor I'm looking for. I have been using for a week and a few days, the effects of alertness and focus are noticble but not so strong. I like that there is no jittering or a crash later on in the day.  Also have had in the afternoon and can still sleep when I'm off to the pillow. I tested this against the more spendy $30 to $50 bags and Maxfit hit the mark.  One of the other brands did not break down as well and I swallowed granules upon last sip.  One of the products upset my stomach because of more caffeine then I wanted. If your looking for a value based coffee replacement this one fits the bill.  My advice try out several and make  your own informed choice.  The other brands were subscriptions and one I have to wait 10 days to cancel. My  email box is filled with spam and pressure ads to purchase.  That turned me away from them instantly.  Buying on Amazon with this brand you get to make your own decision.  Hope this helps anyone looking for a coffee replacement with a little boost. I was not paid to write this, just wanted to post a informed and honest review. Read more | 5.0\nGreat tasting coffee mix I aff it to a cup of hot coffee great wake up energy,I give it a A+ I thought it would taste yucky ,I was wrong great taste Read more | 5.0\nI'm not what you would call a coffee snob. I'm no fan of instant coffee and kinda like traditional coffee pot coffee (Folgers Maxwell House etc) only sometimes. But recently have been bombarded by 100's of ads about mushroom coffee. So why not look into it? After looking at dozens of brands & reading reviews I decided to go with this brand. Many reviews claim it tastes like coffee, let me assure you it does not .. many say the smell is great, for me it's not ... (My girlfriend however loves the smell)  Maybe I only have that morning aroma of the coffee pot brewing to compare it with?) but to me it's a far cry from coffee... BUT I'm not closed minded so I got the water hit & gave it a shot ... 1st I tried it straight up w/no creamers of sweeteners, that's a hard NO for me.... So I put in the slightest bit of sweet cream creamer (about 1/2 what I would with a cup of Folgers or Maxwell House) and the smell was no better for me but the taste was aLOT more tolerable ... Yes it's a little earthy, and a faint hint of cocoa maybe? But definitely doesn't taste like coffee.... Ok, now for what I immediately noticed (or at least convinced myself I noticed??) I've had about 1/8 my normal caffeine intake today after 1 cup... No headache etc. I'm in my 50's so energy levels are typically pretty low, today I noticed a pleasant increase after just 1 cup... I have pretty significant digestive problems & fully expected this to open the flood gate (to put it politely) it did not.... So maybe a plus maybe a negative, to be determined but no acid reflux etc so that's good.  I also struggle with high BP & all those wonderful issues & have had 3 heart attacks.  I typically consume way more caffeine than any grown bull elephant could survive taking in & thus that contributes to circulation issues which only snowballs into fatigue etc etc.  But as I mentioned I cut my intake dramatically today just to test the claims, & to be honest I felt pretty good all day, if you struggle with circulation & BP etc you know you can undeniably notice changes & today I did feel better than I have in a while so for a lack of a better explanation I gotta attribute that to the mushroom coffee, decent energy levels, no heart flutters from my normal lethal dose of caffeine, no heartburn or bitter taste, so take this review for what it's worth, but be aware when you tear open that package the first time try to get the traditional coffee smell expectation out of your mind otherwise you'll likely be discouraged ..  don't expect a cup of Joe like you are accustomed to, cause it's definitely not.... So after one cup only I can say it out performed what I expected & didn't taste anything like I thought it may.  And it's not bad, I can't say it's so back flips good but it's not bad at all .. play with creamer options or maybe blend with your typical coffee but it's worth a try.. Read more | 4.0\nThe best flower than any other one by subscription service.  More affordable, the instant mix is fin ground so it dissolves easily in hot water.  It's easy to use.  I use a 20 oz tumbler so I use 2 tsp of the product.  The caffeine content is perfect, a pick me up without gitters.  Wow, 10 types of mushrooms used.  Double the leading online brand. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the Mushroom Coffee and overall, it's been an interesting experience. The coffee itself has a smooth, mild taste, which I appreciate if you're looking for something a little less intense than traditional coffee. The mushroom blend gives it a unique earthy flavor that takes a bit of getting used to, but it's not unpleasant. I like the idea of the added health benefits, as it’s made with organic mushrooms that are supposed to help with focus and energy. Personally, I didn’t feel a huge boost in energy compared to regular coffee, but I do like that it’s not as jittery or acidic, which is a plus for my stomach. The product is easy to prepare, and I love that it’s organic, so I feel good about what I’m drinking. If you’re someone who enjoys trying new coffee alternatives or want a gentler, healthier option, I’d say it’s worth a try. It’s not a standout for me personally, but it does have its benefits.

I'm really impressed with how they were able to achieve such foam in a can. I can taste the hint of oil from the properly poured espresso. It's magical to me. I used to drink the Starbucks Doubleshot Espresso out of desperation, but La Colombe tastes like a real coffee house beverage. I'm really pleased with this, thank you for creating such a pleasant and easy latte. Read more | 5.0\nThis is so much better than the Starbucks cans.

    "reviews": "Snickerdoodle Original OG Mocha Hazelnut French Vanilla Caramel I recently tried Javy Protein Coffee, and I’m impressed! The flavor is smooth and not overly sweet, making it a great option for anyone who enjoys a well-balanced coffee. The added protein is a huge plus, especially for busy mornings when I need something quick and nutritious. It mixes well with both water and milk, and I love that it doesn’t leave a chalky aftertaste like some other protein drinks. The convenience factor is another win—no need for brewing or messy cleanup. Just mix and go! It gives me a steady energy boost without the jitters, which I appreciate. The only small downside is that I wish the protein content was slightly higher, but overall, it’s a fantastic product that I’ll definitely keep stocked. Highly recommend for coffee lovers who want an extra protein kick! Read more | 5.0\nThe Javy French Vanilla Protein Coffee is a great all-in-one alternative to separate protein powders and coffee. The silky powder (that smells DIVINE) mixes easily with your liquid of choice (I used skim milk) and doesn't leave any chunky bits. It also doesn't create a thick, melted milkshake consistency, either. It stays nice and smooth like a regular iced latte. I did have to add some additional flavoring to mine as there is zero sugar in this and it was a little bit on the bitter side, so plan to add some syrup or other flavoring with it. There are 6 servings in the one bag. I paid approx $20 for mine, so it works out to about $3.35 per coffee. It is definitely less expensive and much faster than the local coffee stand and is a whole lot easier to track calories since I know exactly what is in it. I would definitely recommend this product to a friend! Read more | 5.0\nThis stuff is great! Mixes well with water, no weird lumps. I love this hazelnut flavor because it's not too sweet. I add a few shakes of cinnamon to it, but only because I like the cinnamon-hazelnut combination. Easy way to get extra protein. Only con is price per serving, but you can find pretty substantial savings at the JAVVY website. Read more | 5.0\nThis product did not disappoint. Its packaging is flexible and resealable. The mixing directions are three simple steps and published right on the back. The texture is smooth, the flavor is light and delicious and I feel sustainably full with all the benefits of natural caffeine, no sugar, protein, and a prebiotic with just one scoop. It’s a great grab and go option in the morning. A must try! Read more | 5.0\nI'm really enjoying Javy Protein coffee! One of the biggest advantages I've noticed is that it doesn't cause bloating like other protein coffee brands I've tried in the past. This is a huge win for me, as I can finally get my morning protein and caffeine boost without any uncomfortable side effects. My only suggestion for improvement would be to offer a larger container size - 30 servings would be perfect to last a whole month, rather than the current 20 servings. I've noticed that the caffeine in Javy Protein coffee seems to hit me a bit slower than other coffee products, which I actually prefer. It gives me a sustained energy boost without the jitters. In terms of taste and mixability, I'm impressed! I like to mix Javy Protein coffee with water and a bit of sugar-free vanilla syrup for a delicious and guilt-free treat. It also blends well with almond milk for a creamy and refreshing coffee drink. Overall, I'm a big fan of Javy Protein coffee and would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a low-bloat, high-protein coffee option. Just wish it came in a bigger size! Read more | 4.0\n(From the person this was purchased for) If you think keeping kids, adults, and overenthusiastic retirees entertained at an RV resort is easy, I have a face-painting station and a half-inflated bounce house that would like a word. Enter Javvy French Vanilla Protein Coffee—the only reason I have the energy to go from morning yoga to tie-dye T-shirts to hosting a trivia night all in the same day. First sip? Oh, this is actually good. Not “I’m just drinking this for the protein” tolerable, but delicious. Smooth, real coffee taste, and no weird chalky protein nonsense. Then the caffeine hit. Suddenly, I’m setting up a craft station while explaining pickleball rules to a group of competitive dads, all while dodging a sugar-high child with a water balloon. I’ve got 15g of protein keeping me going, which is great, because I definitely forgot to eat between leading poolside bingo and refereeing a heated game of giant Jenga. Final verdict? If your job requires you to be everywhere at once while still looking like you have it all together, Javvy Protein Coffee is your new best friend. Just be warned—one can and you might accidentally sign yourself up to host karaoke night. Read more | 5.0\nI liked it! It dissolves really easily and quickly and completely. I use a little bit of milk and water. The chocolate taste was very faint. I did add some zero sugar sweet cream, coffee creamer and it was perfect. I love that I got over 20 g of protein in just my drink alone this morning. Read more | 5.0\nReally great macros and pretty good flavor! I don’t generally like protein powder supplements, but this gives me protein and coffee combined. There is a slight aftertaste,l and texture impact, but that’s expected. Read more | 4.0",

Read more | 5.0\nI have bought and consumed  multiple bottles of Javy  in various flavors, and I love the products. Because I have some major reflux issues, I hadn’t found a coffee that did not upset those. However, Javy is the first coffee I found that I can actually enjoy with no negative after effect. Plus, the taste is excellent, and the ability to make iced coffee, especially, is the second biggest reason I love it. The only con, for me, is that although it is cheaper than buying coffee through major chain drive-through‘s, I never bought those anyway due to expense.  So it is still a bit expensive for me, but it is far cheaper than buying one of some more quality from a coffee shop. Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n2.0",

    "reviews": "Bought them for my husband as part of his birthday request. He commutes by train, and this can size it perfect for his trips. In less than two weeks they were gone. He LOVES this coffee, says it is strong, brisk, and doesn't have a chemical aftertaste. We can only buy single cans at local Asian grocery stores, and the shelves are usually nearly empty, because it is a preferred and popular coffee brand. Read more | 5.0\nThis coffee is the perfect way to start your day. Read more | 5.0\nI would drink it every day if I could afford it. It even makes you feel. I guess you would say euphoric. So I drank like $50 worth in three days. It's excellent. I didn't add Creamer or anything. It's just it's like that smooth. Read more | 5.0\nI got hooked on these when I was visiting my friend in Japan. Anytime we would pass a vending machine, you could be certain Boss coffee would be there, and every time I was tempted. If you like canned coffee, then this stuff does not disappoint. I do want to note that if you are used to normal brewed coffee or iced drinks at your local Starbucks, maybe try some canned coffee before going in on this, as it's not cheap. Which brings me to my my gripe, this stuff is simply too expensive when you order it online. Yes, it's fantastic, but it's not $4 a can fantastic. Normally I purchase this stuff at my local Asian grocery store for ~$3 a can, sometimes less, and even then it's a bit of a splurge. Of course If you can't find it anywhere else, and you must have it, then by all means, treat yourself. Read more | 4.0\nWhen I drink coffee, I often want something quick. You can't beat coffee ready in a can! The truth is Boss coffee is a great coffee that takes its quality seriously. Without going into too much detail it's important to know the Japanese take taste and product quality very seriously. Of course you may see a few reviews about dented cans (they ship internationally it makes sense), but it really is important to talk about the taste and quality of this coffee. I drink a lot of coffee ranging from Mom and Pop shops to Starbucks, and I have to say the taste of Boss Coffee to be my favorite. I traveled to Japan a few times and daily my go-to has been small vending machine Boss Coffee. The taste is EXACTLY like what you would experience in Japan, which is nice because for a lot of people the accessibility to Boss Coffee outside of Japan is difficult. The black coffee itself is fresh, without tasting overpowered or over brewed. The convenience of grabbing it and going, adding it to any meal is nice as well. Small bonus to the Japanese writing on the top of the cans. Overall if you want to try something new I highly recommend trying Boss Coffee. I'm hoping we get a lot more flavors in the future! Read more | 5.0\nIve been trying different cold coffee drinks and this is a solid choice, the taste is nice, slightly bitter with a nice smell and aftertaste so I would have to assume they use good quality coffee beans, definitely not bad for your basic no frills black coffee, although the price is steep the branding is novel, and what drew me to try this drink out. The 150mg of caffeine is a guaranteed boost, and Suntory was nice enough to send a thank you email that even said sorry about any dents, although in my case I couldn't detect any dents on any cans even though the packaging allows a lot of free movement, so for that they get all 5 stars from me Read more | 5.0\nThe coffee has a floral sweetness to it. It goes down very easy. Read more | 5.0\nWhen I was in Japan, these coffees were fantastic and available on a lot of street corners. Didnt need to visit a store when I could grab and go one of these. When I found out they were available again I had to get them! Yes they are kinda expensive but they 100% get the job done. They aren't like energy drinks where you might get jittery but they Definitely have enough caffeine to get you going Read more | 5.0",

I like that the packages note where each are from and are clear (with a little bit of translation) on how their made, and what to expect with tasting notes for each. I tried my best to read out the nutrition ingredients, but it was a bit rough . Either way, they seem to have about 30 mg of sodium, no saturated fats, and less than 15 g of sugar, depending on the blend you grab.

    "reviews": "Received the mocha flavor by mistake, but it was delicious. Read more | 5.0\nThis Death Wish Coffee, Iced Coffee Cold Brew, Fair Trade (Original Latte) has a very strong coffee flavor with a slight hint of bitterness.  It is difficult to taste the milk or the limited amount of sugar added.  I do appreciate how there is no bad aftertaste compared to other iced coffee lattes I've had.  This uses fair trade coffee which is nice but then commands a premium price.  Overall, if you like strong coffee taste, this is something I would recommend. Read more | 4.0\nThe Death Wish Coffee, Iced Coffee Cold Brew, Fair Trade (Original Latte) is interesting. The product page only lists Coffee as an ingredient, but it's a latte,so I assumed other ingredients were present. For those that need it, below are the ingredients on the can. As someone who likes to know what I put in my body, \"natural flavor\" as an ingredient makes me pause. What natural flavor? If it's natural, why not state what it is? The flavor is OK, but it has a weird aftertaste. It tastes a little artificial, but I can't put my finger on it. They're a good size at 11 oz each. I would like to try the flavored once as the original isn't as sweet as I usually like. Overall, at $4 each at the time of this review, they're not overly expensive, but they aren't cheap either. A word of caution: the can says to shake it up, but it does spay when you open it after.  It's not like a soda can would spray, but enough to have to wipe up. INGREDIENTS: Milk, Cold Brew Coffee (Water, Coffee), Less than 2% of Sugar, Natural Flavor, Pectin, Salt Read more | 3.0\nI don't drink coffee, so this was for my husband and two adult kids to try out and let me know what they thought. All 3 of them enjoyed it well enough, but one said it had an aftertaste, but they appreciated that it didn't have a bunch of sugar like many of these kinds of drinks will have. All were shocked at how much this costs, $47.88 for a 12 pack of 11oz cans at the time of this review (3/6/25). That's pretty steep...$4/can! I don't have to drink coffee to say \"no thank you\" to that. So while it may be an okay tasting drink, none of them wanted to get it again due to the cost and the fact that the flavor just want there... Especially for such a pricey drink. Read more | 2.0\nDeath Wish Coffee Original Latte is smooth and tastes good. It is not overly sweet or bitter. I shake it up before opening and did not experience any spraying. The ingredients say natural flavoring, definitely would be nice to know what it is. Other than that both of my husband and myself enjoy it. Read more | 5.0\nThis review is for a case of twelve cans.  My wife is the only one who can drink this because I have a dairy allergy.  She takes a can to work and only opens it if she absolutely needs to because she is struggling to stay awake. She says the flavor is amazing but strong!  She actually pours it into a large mug and adds creamer to it that way it goes further and it does not taste as strong. Overall this is a very good quality coffee in a can. Is it worth $48 for twelve cans ($4 per can)  we think it would be more reasonably and realistically priced at $3 per can. Read more | 4.0\nDoesn't taste great. There is a definitely a strong coffee flavor (not really that tasty though) but the sweetener taste is overpowering. The packaging says there aren't any artificial sweeteners, which I believe, but it tastes like there are. I didn't notice any extreme caffeine boost which is actually a relief as I didn't want to be overly wired. Overall, these don't taste that good and are massively expensive. Read more | 3.0\nMade using fair trade certified coffee this latte is absolutely delicious. It has milk and a light amount of sugar added but neither one detract from the bold coffee flavor which results in a not too sweet or too milky latte. The set includes twelve 11 ounce cans and they should be chilled before drinking. Ingredients are milk, cold brew coffee (coffee and water), less than 2 percent sugar, natural flavor, pectin and salt.  To estimate shelf-life at the time of this review in March 2025 the Best Before date is 12 months in the future but dates will vary. Excellent. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "Hawaii Kona Blend Original I bought this because of my insatiable curiosity about Japanese products, especially those found in those wonderful Japanese vending machines. UCC is a major brand of beverages \"since 1969\", found in many Japanese vending machines. I found this \"Coffee with Milk\" to be a perfectly blended mix of coffee and milk, and it is not overwhelmingly sweet - just sweet enough. Just one minor complaint: Every can was dented, although the shipping box showed no sign of damage when I received it. Maybe they were damaged in transit from Japan, and shipped in a new box when they arrived in the US. Not that it mattered to me. The UCC uses some VERY heavy duty cans for their coffee products, and not a single can had lost its vacuum seal. Therefore, all the coffee drinks inside the cans are fine, the damage was purely cosmetic. Since all the UCC coffee drinks are for me, the dents are not a problem. Read more | 5.0\nIt’s a really good coffee. The flavour is well balanced and kind of unique, it’s sweet but not too sweet. I’ll likely buy it again. Read more | 5.0\nLike the 80's but the crack is in a can! This stuff is fabulous. Just the best tasting coffee with the perfect blend of milk and sugar. The only problem is I might start hustling or take up robbery to keep supplied... I used to drink other brands but hands down this is the best! Read more | 5.0\nThe coffee came smashed up and leaking from the box. Amazon were responsible for shipping. Now instead of letting me post a review about the overall experience and the low quality of the coffee, they’ve threatened silencing me for a bad review. Read more | 1.0\nThe UCC coffee itself is great — these are like the cans you might find in a supermarket or vending machine in Japan, or in an Asian grocery store in the US. I will note that the shipping and handling of these cans was less than ideal, they are all significantly dented. The cans were packed tightly in a cardboard box (labeled with “this side up”), but this box was placed in a much larger outer cardboard box, without any additional filling or padding. Given how beat up the outer box looks, I have the impression that this item was handled quite roughly during shipping, and the inner box probably bounced around a lot and thus the cans were all damaged. I’m honestly surprised none of them burst given how dented they are. I guess the damage will probably not cause issues, I was worried that the most dented cans might effectively be pressurized and cause a mess when I open them, but they do usually have some extra space within. I guess I will find out soon enough. Read more | 4.0\nTasty and a good price when bought in bulk.  As others have commented, some of the cans have minor dents, but it’s really not something to worry about since these cans appear to be made from very thick metal.  Will be buying more of these! Read more | 5.0\nLove this brand of coffee, but the box was thoroughly abused by the time it arrived. Don't think I had a single can that wasn't dented. Delicious coffee though Read more | 3.0\nBack in 1977, I did a lot of scuba diving while stationed on Okinawa.  After the dive, there was nothing better than a cold can of UCC coffee from one of their vending machines, seemingly located on every corner.  I'm  so glad to find this again and even though it seems a little pricey, I will continue to purchase it as long as I can find it. Read more | 5.0\n5.0",

    "reviews": "First things first, I do love Everyday Dose! It has been my go-to for some time now and has allowed me to obtain the energy I need when waking up first thing in the morning. I was an avid coffee drinker for years but did not always have time to wait to brew a cup of coffee and there is no coffee maker at my job. I have to admit, I’m a bit addicted to Everyday Dose but I do not like the taste of coffee at all times of the day. Due to this, I sought out an alternative that I recently came across Wisdom Tea and it has been a complete game changer. I was very intrigued at the promise of increased Energy, Mood and Focus – especially on the mood as this is important for me during mid-day. I started using Wisdom Tea in the afternoons as a mid-day pick me up and I have noticed a real difference. I highly recommend using both Everyday Dose and Wisdom Tea the way that I do if you are someone who needs energy, focus and mood boost. Let me give you my full experience on both products and why I enjoy using them both. Everyday Dose is perfect in the morning for me as I enjoy the additional added collagen and amino acids. Being able to get those nutrients in with my coffee every morning has forced me to be consistent with them. Due to this, I have noticed my hair is much thicker and not falling out. I still get to have my coffee fix as I just enjoy the flavor and it’s not too much caffeine to where I feel jittery. As mentioned, outside of the morning – my taste buds just do not crave coffee. Also, I am not a big energy drink fan as I do not enjoy carbonation, and they tend to be expensive. Wisdom Tea is a Yerba Mate based tea that contains unique nootropics that are normally expensive to purchase individually. I know this as I use to take Cognizin capsules and they were expensive, so this is a premium product blend. Wisdom Tea contains not only Organic Lions Mane but Tyrosine, Mucuna Pruriens and Huperzine A. I have never seen all of these nootropics paired together and I can say drinking Wisdom Tea does provide a unique experience and it does what they say it does. After drinking it, I noticed a direct increase in work output, and I tend to end the day off without being in a bad mood – which usually just happens from the mid-day slump of being tired at work. I have a clear mind and sustain clean energy that does not make me crash when I get home. The Sweet Tea flavor is delicious and is a good switch up from coffee. Wisdom Tea is also on Amazon, check it out here if you’re interested: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D891W9YM This is my daily combination and 1-2 punch to feeling like my best self throughout the day. Everyday Dose first thing in the morning and Wisdom Tea in the afternoon – I highly recommend giving it a try. Read more | 5.0\nHey coffee lovers and brain-hackers! So, I've been on this cool journey trying out different coffees to give my brain that extra edge, and I recently stumbled upon Everyday Dose and Alpha Grind. Both these bad boys are like rocket fuel for your brain, but in slightly different ways. Let me break it down for you. Alright, first up is Everyday Dose. This isn't your regular coffee – it's like a zen garden in a cup. They've mixed in some awesome mushrooms (Lion's Mane and Chaga) and other goodies that make your brain feel all smooth and focused. The first time I tried it, I was like, \"Whoa, is this coffee or a brain spa?\" The taste? It's not your typical coffee flavor. It's smoother, kind of earthy – a bit like if coffee decided to take a nature hike. It's perfect for those mornings when you want to wake up your brain without feeling like it's doing jumping jacks. Moving on to Alpha Grind. This one's for the coffee purists who still want that brain boost. It’s like your classic cup of joe went to the gym and got ripped. With nootropics like ashwagandha and Huperzia Serrata, it's got a bolder, more in-your-face flavor in an instant maca base. Drinking Alpha Grind feels like you're gearing up for a mental marathon. It's got this great rich taste, and the brain benefits sneak up on you, giving you this awesome clarity and endurance. It’s my secret weapon on days when my to-do list looks like a monster. Both Everyday Dose and Alpha Grind are like superheroes for your brain, but they’ve got different vibes. Everyday Dose is your chill, thoughtful hero, great for days when you want a gentle brain hug. Alpha Grind? It's the action hero of coffees – bold, strong, and gets you ready to take on the world. For me, Alpha Grind wins by just a hair. I’m a sucker for that classic coffee taste, and when you add the brain-boosting magic to it, it’s like finding out your favorite old-school rock song got remixed into an epic anthem. I found it on Amazon as well if you want to check it out https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BCR5XCV2 If you're looking to mix up your coffee routine and give your brain a bit of a turbo boost, both Everyday Dose and Alpha Grind are worth a shot. They each bring something unique to the table – or should I say, to the mug? Whether you're after a smooth, earthy kick or a classic coffee punch with a twist, these brews have got you covered. So, go ahead, pick your potion, and get ready to supercharge your brain! Read more | 5.0\nAccording to my research, the caffeine content is more akin to decaf than full caff, which I prefer. No jitters so far. Full bodied coffee flavor though. It looks and tastes like a strong cup of black coffee. Smells wonderful! I'll have to report back after I've used it long enough to report on health benefits. I bought this and another mushroom coffee to compare, and I like the taste of this one better, although the other brand has more mushroom ingredients. Sometimes I dissolve a Tbl. of both in a tall glass of unsweetened soy milk, add a dash of monk fruit sweetener, and use the frother to blend. Makes a yummy tall glass of iced coffee. Works like instant coffee, just add hot water and stir. Tastes great, easy to use, and I like that I'm doing something good for my health. Enjoy! Read more | 5.0\nI was pleasantly surprised that I enjoyed this just as I do regular coffee. The taste is great. I have been drinking coffee for almost 20 years and decided I needed to cut back or find an alternative that’s not quite so acidic and hard on my acid reflux. First couple of days my stomach hurt a little but I have never consumed mushrooms before so maybe that’s why? After a few weeks of use and limiting myself to one cup, my heartburn has almost disappeared and my stomach no longer hurts. I do think it’s a bit pricey and this product is actually CHEAPER right now on their website. Read more | 4.0\n5.0\n1.0",

    "reviews": "I originally began purchasing this syrup because it's both sugar and calorie free.  A few years ago, I began my journey on intermittent fasting but black coffee just wasn't in my cards.  I tried another brand and wasn't satisfied.  Then I stumbled upon Jordan's and it made the transition of coffee with creamer to black much easier for me. My only negative is you really need to use it sparingly.  By that, I mean just a few drops.  If you overpour it's going to be INCREDIBLY sweet.  But, if you can steady your hand and just pour a little in, this will make your coffee have some sweet that replaces sugar and creamer. Read more | 5.0\nI use Jordan's Skinny Syrups to make my vanilla latte every single day, and I have to say, the drinkability is top-notch! The flavor is smooth and balanced, dare I say, even better than Starbucks because I can adjust it to my taste without worrying about calorie consumption. It’s a guilt-free way to enjoy flavored coffee since it’s sugar-free and low in calories, perfect for anyone watching their diet. The bottle size is huge, as you can see from the photos, and it lasts me a solid 2 months with daily use. I even use it for other purposes, like whipping up cream foam or adding a touch of flavor to my banana bread recipe. It’s super versatile! Cons: * The flavor might not be for everyone, especially if you’re not used to sugar-free options * Slightly artificial aftertaste, but it’s not overwhelming Overall, I highly recommend it to anyone looking to elevate their coffee game without adding extra calories! Read more | 5.0\nThis Irish Cream flavor Jordan's syrup does not have a lot of Irish Cream flavor \"but\" I find it still to be very versatile with making coffee drinks. I can tell it's a sugar substitute but it doesn't have a bitter after taste so I can still enjoy it mixed in coffee. So that's why I gave it 5 stars. I guess I could have taken away one star for the lack of Irish Cream flavor but I didn't because I still love it. It is really sweet so a little goes a long way for my taste but it makes great iced coffee drinks and I can drink tasty lattes while having \"0 carbs\" without it interfering with me losing weight. I will buy again and keep this on hand for my drinks. Read more | 5.0\nPros: These syrups have flavor. One thing I will say is that they are heavily concentrated so you may only need like a table spoon of syrup. Vanilla is by far the best for me personally, cause it’s a flavor that even in its sugar free form tastes the same for me. These bottles are huge, and obviously they come with 6. The only thing you’ll be replacing like that is the cold brew and the milk you use. I believe this thing can last you half a year at least, even if you’re an avid coffee drinker. 0 calories all around. For my people on a fitness journey needing a syrup to stop making trips to Dunkin or Starbucks? This brand is going to be your best friend. For my people watching their calories for weight loss or other reasons: You don’t need creamer on top of the syrup. I would advise to go with skim milk or oat milk as creamer just has way too many calories because most just never just stick to the one table spoon for real. Cons: As the title says, remember that this is sugar free. This syrup does have that specific after taste that you know it’s sugar free. So if you’re used to Starbucks or Dunkin sweeteners, I’m telling you now that they will not taste the same. The Dunkin or Starbucks will be sweeter, richer, and heavier because their syrups actually have the added sugar and calories. This is a great value alternative, not an 100% dupe. Overall: these sweeteners are good. My personal opinion is that they’re great for people who are trying to sub for Dunkin or Starbucks and trying to lose weight. You won’t feel guilty adding a sweetener because it’s 0 calories. I had to play with the ratios of coffee to milk to syrup definitely to get the right taste I like. I suggest you buy it to try it. If you can find a singular bottle then be my guest and try the singular first before you commit to 6 whole bottles. I gave it 4 stars because when I tasted it the first time I realized it was sugar free. I still really enjoyed my coffee, even did a little dance as I ate breakfast, just not as much as I would’ve enjoyed it if it came from Dunkin lol. That’s just my preference. I think overtime as I use these sweeteners my mindset will change. Read more | 4.0\nI absolutely love this! It adds the perfect amount of sweetness and warm cinnamon flavor to my coffee without any guilt. The taste is rich and indulgent, making every cup feel like a treat. Plus, the price is fantastic—great quality without breaking the bank. I use it in every cup of coffee I drink, and I can't imagine my mornings without it. If you love flavored coffee, this is a must-try! Read more | 5.0\nI am obsessed with this Glazed Donut flavor from Jordan's Skinny Syrups! It has the perfect balance of sweetness with that warm, doughnut-like taste, and it makes my coffee taste like a dessert without any of the guilt. I love that it's zero calories and sugar-free, so I can enjoy it without messing up my diet. I mainly use it in my coffee and oatmeal (shockingly) Read more | 5.0\nThese are soooo good! I’ve been using the Torani sugar free and I absolutely hated the after taste of them. I was nervous to try these and have that same “sugar free after taste” but they don’t have it at all! It actually tastes almost better than the regular syrups with sugar. I’m so happy I found these! Read more | 5.0\nThis is the better tasting sugar free syrups I've tried. Others have a weird artificial taste. I've been buying this specific syrup off amazon for almost 2 years now (I like to make my own creamer) and I cannot understand why the price has increased $3+ dollars just in the last couple months.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Strawberry Original Mint Chocolate Chocolate Café Latte Café Chai Banana Café Mocha INTRO: Soylent is great. I have only been using it for 15 days now on a 95% Soylent-only diet. I'm consuming it at a calorie-deficit 1,500-1,600 kcal/day between this, the bottled 2.0 version, and the powdered version which I subscribe to on their official site (because any listing for it on Amazon at this time is NOT official and way overpriced; Soylent is only sold officially on Amazon in the 2.0 bottled form). I am a male in my mid-30's. I work a desk job so I sit for some 50+ hours/week, though I ride my bike a few times each week and ride anywhere from 20-100 miles each ride. My more common rides are closer to 20-25 but I've already done several century (100 mile) rides this season since February. I have not ridden a century yet since starting Soylent but I have ridden a couple of 80-82 milers and on those rides yes I do consume some Gu energy gels and Clif Shot Bloks to make up for my low 1,500 kcal base. USES: It should be noted that Soylent does not have to be a 100% meal replacement for extended periods of time, such as weeks or months. It is not a 'diet' in and of itself but, like any other food, it can be used as a diet and many have done just that. It is specifically made to be everything your body needs both micro and macro-nutrient-wise and nothing more. It is made to be a convenient, all-encompassing meal replacement and nothing more than that. Some people use it just for 1-2 meals/day when it's not convenient to go out or prepare something. Others use it for all meals each day, and even for extended periods without problems. TASTE: It tastes bland and 'neutral' as they call it. It does not taste bad to me, but it certainly doesn't taste 'great' or 'delicious', though again, it's not supposed to. Myself and most others have no problem with the taste at all and find it easy to drink. Some find it too difficult to drink so they either chug it or flavor it. Myself, I have tasted much worse and actually repulsive drinks in my time and Soylent doesn't even come close to tasting bad or disgusting. Since it is a neutral taste, it does lend itself well to flavorings. You can find loads of different 'recipes' to flavor your Soylent in a simple Google search. TEXTURE: The 2.0 bottled form, which is this Amazon listing, is very smooth with almost no particles or resemblance of texture. The powdered form has quite a bit. It is fairly thick for a drink, similar to the consistency of milk I would say in the 2.0 form and more like a malt or shake in the powdered form. COST: First let me say that if you subscribe to a case of Soylent here on Amazon at least 5x then you get 15% off each case, which is cheaper than on the official Soylent website! Now with that out of the way, it may seem expensive but when you add up how much you spend on your average restaurant meal or on weekly groceries it really isn't that bad. Your average 'meal' of Soylent is far less than your average meal at a restaurant, and a good amount less than what you'd spend on groceries to make a healthy meal. FINAL THOUGHTS: I can't recommend Soylent enough. I still love food and always have, and I don't think that will ever go away. I am not committed to living on 100% Soylent the rest of my life and I don't think anyone should be. Food is enjoyable and very social. Soylent is much less so in both departments. Where it does shine, however, is in it's convenience factor. At work I take two bottles for 800 kcal. I am able to 'eat' (really, drinking) my lunch at my desk while able to get more work done. I'm also able to monitor my caloric intake with ease and between that and my exercise I've lost 10 pounds in the two weeks I've been using it. Give Soylent a try-- If it interests you at all after reading what I've had to say, I don't think you'll be disappointed in the slightest! Read more | 5.0\nThis stuff is a miracle! I've always wished there was just a pill I could take or something so I wouldn't have to worry about eating. I've never had a problem eating too much, my problem was finding the time/motivation to eat enough that I didn't feel tired! It's such a pain, who wants to take HOURS out of every single day to shop, prepare food, eat the food, and clean up the mess? I don't! Before Soylent I mostly ate cereal, frozen food and take out. I'm a picky eater and trying to come up with something that sounded good to eat every day was almost becoming a point of anxiety for me. I had begun counting my calories to see if I was eating enough and discovered I was getting maybe 800-1000 calories in an average day. I'd work all day and at 8pm desperately try to eat a day's worth of food all at once but just couldn't consume enough in one sitting. Now, since it takes no time or effort to prepare my food I can take in meals throughout the day, like a normal person, and I feel so much better! More energy and my skin has improved. Now, onto the serious matter of taste. When I first began Soylent they only had original flavor and I practically gagged my way through the first bottle. I was bitterly disappointed and couldn't imagine drinking 4-5 a day. I did some research and decided to try adding a little chocolate Nesquick to it. That worked great! I blew threw a can of Nesquick in under a month and when it ran out, I tried it plain again and discovered the original flavor wasn't so bad anymore. It just took a little getting used to. I still occasionally add strawberry or chocolate Nesquick to my original bottles, but it's not really necessary. Like some other people, I hated the Nectar at first sip. It tasted like floral perfume in my mouth, it was awful. But a couple bottles in, I found myself liking it and for a while it was even my favorite flavor. Similar to the Nectar, the Cacao wasn't great when I first tried it either. I thought it was too nutty and had a fake chocolate taste. That quickly changed and now it tastes like a perfect chocolate milk and is hands down the best flavor available. If I were to introduce a friend to Soylent, I would start with Cacao, I've also tried the powder and really really wanted to like it, but seriously couldn't handle the taste. I figured it would be an acquired taste for me, like the other flavors, but after a day and half of plugging my nose to chug the stuff and then trying to rinse the taste out of my mouth afterwards, I just gave up on it. I felt like I could taste wallpaper paste all day and night after a glass of Soylent powder! Other stuff: SALT. This one is kind of important. Soylent is very low sodium, which is good for you, but can make you crave salty foods, especially at first. I started craving potato chips and fries like crazy. Which was fine by me, I wasn't trying to restrict my diet, so I just ate some chips. But I eventually found it was cheaper/easier/better to just add a pinch of salt to a bottle now and then. Plus after 6 months or so the salt cravings are mostly gone, but I still enjoy some saltine crackers as my snack most days. OTHER FOOD is amazing when you drink 90% Soylent. I usually drink 4 bottles a day + a snack to reach about 1800 calories. All sorts of food are just bursting with flavor now! A sip of juice is like eating a delicious fruit candy drink. I don't feel deprived at all, I feel like I am able to appreciate all the little nuisances of taste and flavor, that most people so used to they don't even notice. The only bad bit: I'm addicted! I HAAAATE running out of Soylent and would pay a premium to go buy a case locally once in a while, when I am stupid and forget to re-order in time. When I have to switch back to 'regular' food, I feel sick. It's probably because I am pretty much dumping poison into a body that is used to a near-perfect balanced diet that is always the same. Running out of Soylent for me usually means starvation followed by pizza, burgers and frozen chicken nuggets, followed by diarrhea, lethargy and mood swings. :( Read more | 5.0\n1.0",

    "reviews": "60 Servings 30 Servings Very delicious and a better alternative to coffee. I really like it does what it says. Focused, alert, high energy and best of all, it helps digestion. I work out regularly and with this, I am noticing a fast outcome than normal. The taste of it is a bit different if you're use to coffee, but it grows on you. I actually enjoy it more now so than coffee to be honest. I enjoy the creamer as well (though a whip cream can is always #1). I also just got the cocoa mix for night. Excited to try! Read more | 5.0\nI am not a coffee connoisseur by any means. In fact I gave up coffee in 2018 because of some nervous system issues. I have always missed the smell and the few times that I have had a sip throughout the years I disliked feeling and tasting the acidity. Now that my nervous system issues have been managed I ventured to try Ryze, even though I put it off for a few months not being able to justify the expense. Well, I'm sure glad I gave it a shot on Subscribe & Save. I find the taste delicious and satisfying. I also feel it is so much smoother than regular coffee and I don't taste the acidity. I've also noticed being slightly more perky (well duh, it has caffeine and I've been caffeine free-ish for 7 years), but there is no crash or need for more than just the one cup to sustain the feeling throughout the day, but still able to fall asleep at night. Additionally, I have noticed after a week that much inflammation in my body has lessened. So I'm a believer! Read more | 5.0\nFor 7 days I’ve had Ryze and have noticed a difference in energy levels. I have more energy throughout a full day and better focus. I feel lighter on my feet and inflammation has gone down. I have noticed a little insomnia and vivid dreams but nothing alarming. Also noticed dry mouth but drinking water consistently throughout the day improves the symptom. I’ll continue for 30 days and notate results. Does not have a coffee or mushroom taste. I drink it iced with French vanilla oat creamer and like the taste with that combination. Read more | 5.0\nI have tried a couple mushroom coffees in search of a less jittery buzz and this is an OK coffee-like drink but is overhyped, it has a dusty instant coffee taste but don't expect a rich deep Jamaican blue mountain coffee experience or strong caffeine lift. As for all the so-called health benefits, they are all TBD, no one has real evidence of true health benefits, that I have seen.  Are mushrooms good for you?  sure, just as  most organic foods are.  But for some reason mushrooms have a dark unknown lore about them with claims of everything from super brain health to outrageous sex drive.  Let me put it bluntly, most of the claims are complete nonsense.  Claims of improved libido in women via improved blood flow to \"lady parts\"?  come on. This provides no more improved libido than a regular cup of coffee would.  If you want to see a woman's libido improved, put tequila in it. The taste is very similar to many other instant coffees which most folks don't prefer and only drink when there is no other choice.  This to me has a dusty or dirt flavor with some watery instant coffee after tones.  With cream it is not as bad but I think most people are expecting something so bad when they taste it they say, hmm, its not bad when they actually try it.  That's different from saying this is awesome. They must add some instant coffee to the mix of mushrooms powder they have. That is what it taste like. I don't buy all the health hype which is mostly subjective and anecdotal at best.  What I will say is this, it is less jittery than a Starbucks brew.  If you have stomach issues with coffee, give a cold brew a try.  That seems much less acid than regular coffee, at least it did for me and you will get more than 30 servings for a fraction of the price. I think what I dislike the most is the cost.  It is way too expensive for what you get and I think this is a social media pump and dump. I tried it for several days now and it is OK as a coffee-like beverage, but it is not a good cup of coffee.  It will not impact your stomach as much as regular coffee will, but you sacrifice real coffee taste, and you don't get much caffeine lift. It is a flat, dusty like instant coffee experience. Lastly, don't expect magical health benefits.  Personally, I think it is a fad and will wear out like fondue, gelatin, pet rocks and mood rings.  But if you enjoy it and it makes you feel healthier, gives you higher energy, more peaceful sleep, laser sharp focus, improved immune system, better digestion and a longer life with better immunity and a hot sex life as claimed.... (and don't mind the price), then be all you can be and enjoy.  I'll stick to my cold brew. Positives: • not bad (just not great either) • convenient and fast to make • Less impactful to stomach compared to real coffee Negatives: • Overpriced • too many unrealized claimed benefits Overall, I would say a good cold brew is better and less expensive but give it a try for yourself.  You may enjoy it more than I do. I think it is an OK drink that is overpriced. UPDATE: Customer service got in touch with me and refunded my money.  I was both surprised and pleased.  They saw I was not completely satisfied with the item, and they refunded my purchase.  Kudos to customer service department. I am not going to change my rating, but I wanted to let you know that customer service good. 3 stars Read more | 3.0\nSo mushroom coffee, supplements, etc are all the rage right now and I normally don't buy into the hype on that type of thing but my wife has been having some challenges with becoming easily agitated and this was supposed to help with mood so I figured why not. First of all the taste...it's different.  It's got a very unique flavor.  I don't like mushrooms but the taste of this isn't bad if you drink it straight.  The flavor is very strong, but not bad.  I did try adding a little bit of milk to it and that made it much better.  I do notice a slight sense of calm after drinking a cup but it's not life changing. What actually sold me on this was an add I saw on that Social Media app everyone is endlessly scrolling on and a woman was claiming that her sex life went to the next level after drinking this.  I would say that is an unrealistic expectation.  But the coffee is pretty good, but the claims may be overhyped or I may just need to drink it more regularly to get a better effect, but I still prefer regular coffe. Read more | 4.0\nI have been taking the Ryze Coffee with Creamer and I can tell a slight difference. The taste is not that bad at all. It has a hint of coconut to it but not overpowering. In my opinion it tastes like a watered down ice coffee. If you are looking for a strong traditional coffee taste, it does not have that. It's light. The first day I could tell I was a bit more focused and was craving water and cravings for sweets wasn't as strong. The second day, my gut begin to respond and let's just say, it cleans you out without the stomach gripe. Day 3 I have little to no cravings for sweets. Also you may be a bit gassy so always check to make sure no one is standing behind you lol. But you feel so much better. Can't wait to see my results after 30 days. Also be sure to stir it well so that you don't get the chalky taste at the bottom of the cup when you taking the last few sips. But overall, Its a good buy. It smells so good soon as you open the bag. Read more | 5.0",

It dissolves well and isn't bitter at all. I'm not a sweet coffee gal but I will put a bit of sugar in an iced latte. This didn't need anymore sugar or syrup and was sweet enough as is. I thought it was a medium strength and held up to ice fairly well. Very convenient for travel and work. Good value for the price as an iced coffee at any coffee shop will run you way more $$ than this pack will. Read more | 4.0\nI really enjoy these cold brew stick packs. I have tried the vanilla flavor before as well and can say I am surprised by how there is truly a coffee taste. Typically with these powdered mixes, you’re left wanting more but the use of arabica beans gives you that true coffee aroma. My wife has been gulping this stuff down which is great because a $2 daily cup of cold brew is better than the $7 daily cup from the shop down the road! It’s also super easy to make! Add water and stir! We typically add a little bit of DaVinci’s syrup and cream to customize the flavor as well! Great quality and great value for your money!! Read more | 5.0\nThought I'd try it and I ended up liking them. Read more | 5.0\nEasy to make great taste and quality for the money Read more | 5.0\nThe DaVinci Gourmet Slightly Sweet Cold Brew Stick Pack is a convenient presweetened coffee that is quick, easy to make and tastes delicious.  The coffee is like most any other instant coffee stick.  To make, simply mix the coffee blend in 8-12 ounces of water (depending on the strength) add ice if you like, and you're good to go.  I found this coffee tasted great as is, but to make it a richer treat, you can add the milk of your choice.  The coffee dissolves easily, tastes rich but not overly bitter, and it's sweet enough to make it palatable but not so sweet that it's cloying.  There is enough caffeine in the coffee to help give me a little caffeine boost when I'm feeling tired without the coffee making me feel wired.  While I enjoyed this coffee, it wasn't unique enough for me to want to purchase it again.  The coffee is good, but if given the choice, I will stick with my usual instant coffee blend and sweeten it as needed.  If we're discussing convenience only, other stick coffee blends taste just as good and are more budget-friendly, so I won't be switching brands anytime soon.  Overall, this is worth trying, but it is not something I would purchase regularly. Read more | 4.0\nI absolutely love these cold brew stick packs! They are so convenient to use and the coffee powder dissolves easily in water. The slightly sweet flavor is just right, not too overpowering. It's a great pick-me-up for busy mornings or when I need a quick caffeine boost. Definitely a must-have in my pantry! Read more | 5.0\nI’m always on the lookout for quick coffee solutions, and this cold brew coffee mix hit the mark! It’s super convenient—just stir in water, add ice, and you have a smooth, slightly sweet cold brew in seconds. The flavor is bold but not overpowering, with just the right amount of sweetness. I’ve been using it for busy mornings and even on the go, and honestly, it’s making me reconsider my usual coffee routine. For anyone who loves cold brew but doesn’t want the hassle, this is a must-try. Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0",

The manufacturer is still selling this product through other channels for the old price of $36 and I did reach out to ask them if this was a mistake on their end but heard nothing back. So either the Manufacturer is trying to dissuade you from buying this production on Amazon or Amazons pricing logic has gone haywire. Shame, because it is a good product, but obviously not worth a almost 45% price increase. It has actually increased by another $7 (with the 15% subscription discount) since the Amazon email notifying me the price was going up from $36 to $46 in October 2024.

    "reviews": "The media could not be loaded. Been trying this coffee blend for about 3 weeks now as part of my morning ritual. The medium roast Arabica base has a nice smooth flavor without any bitter aftertaste. Really appreciate how easy it is to prepare - just one scoop per cup and it dissolves completely in both hot and cold water without any clumping. The aroma is rich and earthy with subtle notes that make it unique from regular coffee. Found it works great in my regular coffee routine, whether im making it hot in the morning or as an afternoon iced drink. The scoop size is perfect for getting the right strength every time. Really like how it mixes instantly - no need for extra stirring or waiting. One thing to note is that the taste is different from traditional coffee but in an interesting way - took a couple days to get used to the unique flavor profile. The powder stays fresh in the container without clumping up even in humid weather. Really appreciate that it doesnt leave any gritty residue at the bottom of my cup. Only wish it came in a larger size container since im going through it pretty quickly. Makes my morning coffee routine feel a bit more special than just regular instant coffee. The seal on the container keeps everything fresh and the scoop is easy to find without digging around.​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​ Read more | 5.0\nLove this coffee!!! I don’t notice much of a mushroom smell, or taste for that matter. It’s cheaper than some of the other options so I have ended up purchasing it several times since. I have fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue so I’m always struggling with fatigue and cognitive issues. I haven’t noticed of it does much for my energy levels but I can certainly tell a difference in my mental clarity when I use this. Since it’s so helpful and great quality, I will continue to purchase those mushroom coffee. Read more | 5.0\nI purchased this coffee trying mushroom coffee for the first time. Chose this brand because it was one of the cheaper brands. Love the coffee aroma. The taste with coffee creamer or milk is absolutely delicious. You do get aftereffects of slight jitters. Had energy after drinking. Also, increased ale libido after drinking. As long as the process remains cheap, I will purchase this brand again. Read more | 4.0\nLet me just say thank you so much for this brand. I bought both. The flavor is amazing beats coffee anyday I can drink it black, and if I want a do a splash of milk. Not even needing sugar. I did the switch to this over coffee as I wanted actual benefits to my coffee. Doesn't give me jitters, anxiety nothing. And then on top of feeling better I seen this slim coffee one had berberine so I'm like perfect for what I'm looking for, am drinking it now amazing. So thank you, and the price is excellent for how many coffee cups you get. I'll never drink reg coffee again. Read more | 5.0\nI love this! The smell of this is so amazing and I love the fact that it doesn't prevent me from sleeping at nights like regular coffee. I drink mine on a empty stomach first thing in the morning. I add my collagen powder and my hazlenut creamer and it taste great. Read more | 5.0\nNot bad tasting afa the mushrooms. It's the instant coffee that I don't care for. I loveee coffee. Nmw kind of instant coffee it is, they all taste like instant coffee! I can't get past it. I drink it as much as I can then go back to regular coffee. I do like it though. I'm hoping in time I'll get past the taste of instant coffee n it can become a daily thing. Read more | 5.0\nFIRST: this appears a probiotic blend, so do not mix with other drinks with probiotics-as to much Dr informed!  This can be a hit or miss as flavor wise; depending how much used, as a bit strong on the all the ingredients, and the coffee taste not really there. With that said, I add cream only, and it is ok. I can tell that my mental focus has improved as drink before doing daily paperwork, and am lasered in. The low acid has really helped my stomach, and along with other mushroom coffees getting me away from jitters, but price per cup is getting up there. Read more | 3.0\nthis mushroom coffee is so delicious that I ask my boss if she wanted to try it and she just loved it she went right ahead and order herself one for her it has the curry in it but it doesn't even taste like Curry you cannot even taste it it tastes like coffee is so good so delicious but you will not be missing the coffee it tastes even better than coffee absolutely 10 out of 10 Read more | 5.0",

Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love this product.  I can drink several cups a day without caffeine.  It tastes like coffee with a tiny hint of chocolate.  I like it with powdered creamer. Read more | 5.0\nUsually chicory has a very specific taste. But this one pleasantly surprised me with both taste and delicate texture, it dissolves well. A very pleasant morning drink. I'll buy more!!! Read more | 5.0\nThe only reason I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5 stars is because I'm too used to drinking coffee and I'd rather not have anything at all if I can't have coffee. This really isn't bad, but if you're trying to kick the coffee habit, it'll work. And it's good for you! I had to stop drinking coffee because of heartburn and dealing with reflux. It's a bit pricey, and Amazon won't take returns. So be cautious, if you're going to buy it. Read more | 4.0\nMix the two together taste good Read more | 5.0\nI bought this because I read that chicory root has inulin which is a type prebiotic.  Chicory is also a rich source of beta-carotene.  I am constipated a lot.  I eat a lot of fiber with fruits and vegetables but never really feel cleaned out.  Well.. no more of that!  I bought this Chicory brand with Dandelion and every morning I am fully expelled.  It's crazy! It took about a week or so adding a tablespoon of this chicory root into my coffee with collagen and stevia.  Trying not to be too gross but My large bowel movements have been flowing with ease.  Never experienced this before every day! Read more | 5.0\n(Note: this bag is marked Product of Ukraine, although it has a business address in Utah. At the time of this review, Ukraine is under siege. I don't know the future of this product, but I hope it returns with the success of its people.) I struggled for months trying coffee alternatives when coffee was no longer an option for me. This was the home run I'd been looking for. Initially, I tried the dandelion variety, but when it was no longer available, I ordered the raspberry and ran a taste test for future reference. I tried them three ways against each other: black, with oat milk, and with oat milk and sugar. Black: this is where the contrast was most notable. The dandelion flavor is more bitter, but this isn't a bad thing for those looking for a more coffee-like flavor. It has a more complex flavor than the raspberry, and though a bit strong, like deep-roasted French coffee, it has its charm. The raspberry came off more like a very light breakfast blend of coffee, almost tea-like. With oat milk: at first, I liked the raspberry a bit better on the milk test, as it tasted more like my usual milk-sugar-coffee. But after several sips, I definitely leaned again towards the dandelion, with its more complex undertones. That said, with my remaining raspberry, I'll probably drink it just with milk: it played nicely with it, and came across as a very mellow coffee. With oat milk and sugar: the raspberry, with milk and sugar, seemed a bit overwhelmed. It was too sweet, without enough complexity. The dandelion stood up much better, and I could still taste its undertones through the other layers. Bottom line: considering that younger people have a better sense of smell and taste and often have an aversion to bitterness, the raspberry tastes to me like a young person's coffee. The dandelion, on the other hand, tastes like a more robust coffee suited to older drinkers. For reference, I'm in my forties. Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor is an acquired taste.  I drink it because it’s relatively less expensive per cup when you consider all the other coffee substitutes that are available.  It’s worth a try but not satisfying if your an avid coffee drinker Read more | 3.0",

Bad tour guides.. Flavor is ok, taste a little of the dark caramel compared to mocha there is no mocha flavor but more like ginseng and guarana. The white chocolate has a more neutral flavor and the white chocolate flavor is barely there but ok. I still prefer the mocha even though I don’t taste the mocha. Back on the caramel flavor, I set it up for subscribe and save. And just today they jacked the price of $45 and change. Caramel version is in no way anywhere near worth that price and if the other flavors get price jacked as well then I will retaliate and switch over to monster or even victor allens. Caned caffein.

    "reviews": "NEW! Vanilla NEW! Coconut Acai Matcha Coconut Acai Chocolate Vanilla Today is the first day trying Ka’chava. I purchased the vanilla. I skip lunch a lot. I have dangerously low iron (anemia.) Not a good combo for chasing a toddler around all day. I was looking for something to help bridge my nutritional gap for days when I don’t eat until 6pm, one meal a day. Why am I so tired all the time? Well…. I made a half serving in my little portable blendjet thingy. That’s all that fit. It’s a big ol scoop. 2 scoops is a serving. I was too tired to get  the big blender out and make a full serving. I mixed it with full fat coconut milk and a little water so the weak a$$ blender could mix the shake. On first sip it was very forward tasting vanilla. Like drinking vanilla cake batter. Not artificial tasting not overly sweet. Just good. I’m not a big sweets person. So if you love super sweet things this may not be your flavor profile. The texture was smooth I didn’t notice any chalky texture. The little blender left some dry pockets of powder but by the time I got to those I didn’t care, I sucked the first one down FAST. I was practically licking the glass out to get every expensive drop. I immediately made a second half serving and sucked that down. I’m sitting here afterwards feeling completely satisfied. Before I drank them I was starving! Like weak and shaky starving. (Why do I do that to myself ugh) my 3 year old had a couple ounces with me even he loved it. Being that it’s whole food vitamins it should be fine for him in small quantities? Right? Well this little kid eats like a picky toddler, sometimes he diet reflects in naughty toddler behaviors. After he drank 2-3 ozs he sat down and calmly put a puzzle together which by this time of day he would be throwing pieces around the house crashing his toy trucks into the walls. How am I feeling? Focused full happy. My body felt immediately tingling like it does when I drink green juices. I feel elevated. Is it expensive? Yes. But now I understand why. Also some of these bad reviews on here could it be that they ordered on Amazon from a reseller? Because they are on here, marking it up, reselling from who knows where and how it was stored. Just a thought, because I don’t know how anyone can give this anything less than 5 stars! Also I’ll try to remember to update my review and see if it helps with my nutritional deficiencies Editing to add to 1/18/24 My 20 year old daughter tried it. She said it tasted and smelled like paper. She did not like it by itself, I dumped her glass in the blender, added strawberries and a banana. She drank it all and asked for a second glass. This girl is sadly despite a healthy upbringing is a victim of the Standard American Diet. I ordered her a bag now too. She said she wants to get back to the gym now, she’s feeling healthier after a couple days substituting lunch with a shake. She also said she’s sleeping better now too.  Good stuff! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love this plant based protein powder! I am not vegan so I was a bit hesitant in trying it for the first time but I wanted to see what the hype was about. And it did not disappoint. Alot of people mention the protein powders earthy taste but I don't get those flavors at all. The chocolate has been my absolute favorite flavor. I blend mine with 12oz of water, half of banana, peanut butter fit powder, a date for sweetness, with cinnamon, a little nutmeg and vanilla extract every morning and I can't get enough. And surprisingly without milk it's so creamy. It leaves me feeling full until lunch and sometimes I'm not even hungry by lunch. I've even tried just the powder by itself with 12oz of water in my shaker cup without the fixings and it still is very tasty. It mixes extremely well. It's not too thick but just the perfect texture and there's no residual powder left on your palate. I have more energy in the gym and it helps me to stay in a calorie deficit along with a healthy and balanced lunch and dinner. It's a bit expensive but it's worth every penny! What are you waiting for, buy it already! Read more | 5.0\nHave been feeling meh so I've been doing a reset using this product. It tastes just fine blended with water, but I prefer using 8oz H2O and 8oz of cow or (powdered) goat milk. And ice. I add: collogen, CocoaVia Cardio Health Cocoa, powdered colostrum, and a packet of Supergut GLP-1 Booster. Sometimes I'll throw in other stuff depending on my mood/needs. I go with the flow. Makes two large servings which are my main meals. I eat a solid keto meal for lunch. Some bone broth, celery, or apples if I need a snack. The taste is creamy, keeps me full and gives me energy. Sometimes I only use one scoop and throw in a scoop of whey or some other protein powder in my pantry. My brain fog lifts whenever I drink this. Great in the morning especially. I'm slowly coming out of whatever funk I was experiencing. My sleep is much better. Mood is balanced & upbeat. I have more sustained energy in the gym. Skin looks clearer, joints moving well. Not sure what all the complaints in the reviews are about. It's a nutritionally dense product that is expensive. If you mix it in a blender, it's smooth and creamy. If it's too thin for your taste use a milk. The \"controversy\" about this stuff cracks me up. It's a protein shake. Drink it (or don't.) No need to stress out or overthink it. I'll continue to purchase, works for me. Read more | 4.0\nAbsolutely the best of all the “superfood powder” shake mixes. Started 2025 wanting to begin the day much healthier than in 2024. Two full months in and my weight is down 15 pounds - have not joined a gym. The biggest nugget I can share is that sweet and salty cravings have dropped a lot. Be weary if you’re a handshaker. I use a ninja and need a couple pulses to get all the powder diluted. Highly recommend.

    "reviews": "my new favorite coffee. The flavor is great, smooth, not acidic so no more heart burn. It does not give me the jitters at all and I get those bad. I'm caffeine sensitive. I have purchased a couple times and am getting ready to get more. Read more | 5.0\nThis is the ONLY coffee I can drink that doesn’t cause me to be nauseated for hours after drinking. It’s truly amazing to drink a cup and go about my day while enjoying it! I’m so thankful for this coffee! It is way too expensive, but they know I’ll buy it, because it’s the only coffee that doesn’t make me sick! The flavor is also superior to anything I’ve ever gotten from a grocery store and it certainly gives me energy, so it’s definitely 💯 plenty strong! 10/10 recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe strength, aroma, taste were all pleasant. I tried this coffee because I am very allergic to mold and I didn’t realize how much mold is in regular store bought coffee. It is very costly and I didn’t really see any changes in my body as suggested. However, I do like to support companies that use less pesticides and stay as organic as possible. Read more | 4.0\nfast service Read more | 5.0\nI was recommended this coffee due to my Gerd and was told this offers a much lower acidic brew. Great brew, great taste. I am very pleasantly surprised. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried Lifeboost Coffee Ground Medium Roast, and while it’s not a total disaster, it certainly didn’t live up to the hype. First off, the price is pretty steep for what you get. I was expecting a premium experience given the cost, but the flavor fell flat. The coffee does have a medium roast profile, but it lacks the depth and richness that you’d expect from a high-quality coffee. The low acid claim is accurate, which might be a plus for some, but it comes at the expense of a more complex flavor. Instead, it’s a bit on the bland side with an underwhelming taste. To make matters worse, there’s a noticeable bitterness that lingers, which detracts from any potential enjoyment. On the positive side, it’s USDA Organic, which is nice if that’s a priority for you, but I’d say there are better options out there for the price. Overall, it’s an okay coffee, but I wouldn’t recommend it unless you’re specifically looking for a low-acid, organic option and are willing to pay a premium for it. Read more | 3.0\nFantastic, delicious coffee for people who need low acid and want to enjoy a good cup of coffee!  I have interstitial cystitis and this is the best coffee I've tried!  Highly recommend!!! Read more | 5.0\nThis coffee was just delivered to me yesterday so this morning I immediately wanted to try it. I did a single serving pour over. I poured about 4 ounces into filter going into a glass mug. I'm glad I used a clear mug because I stopped after pouring 4-5 oz. The coffee looked extremely weak. I will need to use twice as much coffee, at least, to get the proper strength And I am not a strong coffee lover. I typically use one scoop per cup when many coffee drinkers use 2 scoops per cup. So strong coffee lovers beware: you'll want to go 3-4 scoops for every cup you brew with this coffee. Which means this coffee will be gone in no time! And it's so expensive to begin with.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Salted Caramel Cappuccino Maple Donut I've ordered these quite a few times. I've tried all the flavors. They are all equally delicious! I love this particular brand for a few reasons: 1. Nutritional. 10 grams of protein and the ingredients look clean for the most part! It's also low in calorie. 2. Reasonably priced. Most 12 pack of protein coffees cost almost twice the price of this. Alani nu is very reasonably priced. 3. 100mg of caffeine per bottle. Most packaged cold brews contain 200mg of caffeine per serving. I like alani nu coffee because I drink one bottle with breakfast and one with lunch, it helps fill me up so that I eat less, and I can spread out my caffeine intake into 100mg increments. 3. Convenient packaging. As a busy mom, I LOVE that this bottle design has a lid. This way I can drink the coffee at my own pace, on the go, with no spills or mess! All in all, 10/10! DeLICIOUS! Read more | 5.0\nI bought a case of cappuccino and maple donut. The cappuccino wasn't the best experience and had that familiar protein powder flavor with bad aftertaste. The maple donut however was a quite pleasant experience that reminded me of cereal milk and butter pecan ice cream, the coffee flavor could have been more noticeable but I could see using this as a creamer + sugar substitute in coffee. I really like this supplement drink. Read more | 5.0\nThis doesn't have the absolute best nutrition profile for a protein coffee, but it's reasonably low in added sugar with about the same amount of protein as milk (I recommend Premier Protein coffee shakes for better nutrition with a similarly good taste). The price amounts to the same as the grocery store for me. I wish it were cheaper since it's a bulk quantity. But I am glad that it's available with the convenience of Prime so I'm not tempted to buy out full stock at the grocery store. It arrived without any shipping issues. Read more | 4.0\nThese! I love these things to where I had to make myself quit buying the boxes! The Mocha & Cappuccino are my favorites, then Vanilla (I don't like Maple Donut at all). After having one I'm always awake & ready to go. I love starting my day with them. It's a very smooth drink, not to sweet, & not a strong flavor. Literally everything in it is the right amount for me. If you like coffee & looking for a protein drink try this, but I recommend looking at the website. They have bogo sales. 😉 Read more | 5.0\nI love maple donuts, and as a night shift worker have had Alani Nu's various protein coffees and energy drinks recommended to me by several coworkers. So, when Alani Nu products were discounted during Prime Day, I thought that buying a pack of the Maple Donut Protein Coffees would be a gimme. Well, unfortunately... not quite. While the protein coffee itself is quite drinkable (texture is smooth, no powdery/unmixed protein clumps), I am just not a fan of the Maple Donut flavour, I'm afraid. It doesn't taste like maple or donut, but some weird artificial/synthetic attempt at... something?  It's not outright repulsive, but it is certainly not anything I would choose to taste, if given other options. I did not notice any real energy boost, but I have a pretty high caffeine tolerance. Bottom line: it took me 5 months to get through a 12 pack just because I would always find myself reaching for any other protein coffee flavour I had chilled instead. I had to consciously remind myself & force myself to drink the Maple Donut bottles. I tried to give one away, but the person took one sip and wasn't a fan, so I just decided to power through the pack myself. I think that if you want a lower-calorie pre-mixed protein coffee, I'd encourage you to give Alani Nu a shot - just try one of the more traditional flavours, since I'd be surprised if they messed up vanilla, you know? But I can't recommend Maple Donut. Read more | 3.0\nI have been on the lookout for a protein coffee that doesn’t give that obvious protein taste. I finally tried this maple donut one and I am OBSESSED! It might be a tad bit too sweet for those who don’t like sweet things. My favorite way to have these is to pour it over ice. If I’m feeling like I won’t be able to get through the day, I would add a double shot of espresso and this combo will instantly give me so much energy and keep me awake (be mindful with this combo because it has put me on edge lol). Overall, I feel that this is best protein coffee out there and Alani Nu products have never failed to disappoint. Read more | 5.0\nI love this drink! The taste is fantastic and does not make you feel like you are consuming per chemicals. Read more | 5.0\nThese taste a little chalky in my opinion and they’re also a little too sweet for my liking. However they are low calorie and have a low sugar content. Read more | 3.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n3.0\n2.0",

    "reviews": "I love this coffee. Awesome taste. Smells so good and fills the house with such a beautiful scent while the coffee is brewing. The price is very good and the quaility is excellent. You get alot of coffee pods, so it gives you alot more to enjoy. Taste better than other coffees I have tried. I do recommend it. Read more | 5.0\nThe variety pack is a great purchase allowing experimentation with different flavors and roast levels. The 100% Colombian flavor is rich and satisfying. The single-serve pods are ideal for my Keurig K-Cup brewer. The French Roast flavor is strong and robust, while the Morning Blend is light and perfect for starting the day. The 100% Arabica beans enhance the coffee quality. It's also Kosher certified. A truly remarkable coffee experience! Read more | 5.0\nThe reason I think this is a really great product is because of the Morning Blend flavor which was my absolute favorite. The taste was smooth and it perfectly kickstarted my day. An add-on is that it is also a great deal. The overall taste of all the flavors is good. I am quite happy with this purchase. Read more | 5.0\nI've been using the Victor Allen's coffee pods and I must say, the variety is superb. The different roasts cater to my ever-changing moods and preferences. The single serve pods are convenient, perfect for my daily routine. The French roast is my absolute favorite. The only slight drawback is that the flavor intensity could be a bit more robust, but otherwise, it's a solid choice for coffee lovers. Read more | 4.0\nPlease consider this an objective review. Some of the items can be reviewed by a simple one sentence. Sometime I am brutally honest and that it is only my opinion. This is my review on This is my review on Victor Allen's Coffee Italian Roast Capsules, Single Serve Coffee Pods (Pack of 1), 0.02 pounds | Dark Roast | 42 Count | Keurig K-Cup Brewers As an avid coffee enthusiast and a dedicated shopper on the hunt for the perfect Italian Roast, I came across this remarkable find that has genuinely exceeded my expectations. Like many other shoppers, I was looking for a quality coffee that wouldn't break the bank, and I can confidently say that this one hits all the right notes. From the moment I opened the bag, I was greeted by an enticing aroma that promised a rich flavor experience. Brewing this Italian Roast is not just a routine; it's a delightful ritual. The aroma fills my kitchen, creating an inviting atmosphere that sets the tone for the day. Each sip offers a robust and well-balanced taste, capturing the essence of a traditional Italian coffee experience. The flavor profile is rich without being overwhelming, and I find it perfectly suited for any time of day—whether it's a morning boost or an afternoon pick-me-up. One of the standout aspects of this coffee is the affordability. It feels like a small luxury that doesn't come with a hefty price tag. It's rare to find such quality coffee at a reasonable price, especially for an Italian Roast, which is often associated with higher-end offerings. This product truly bridges the gap between quality and cost, making it accessible for all coffee lovers. If there's one drawback, it’s simply that I wish they offered this incredible roast in larger quantities. I find myself reaching for it frequently, and it would be fantastic to stock up without worrying about running out too quickly. Nevertheless, this small wish doesn’t detract from my overall appreciation of the product. In conclusion, if you’re in search of a fantastic Italian Roast coffee that delivers on flavor and affordability, look no further! This coffee has quickly become a staple in my kitchen, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with a passion for rich coffee experiences. I can’t wait for them to expand the offering to larger quantity, but until then, I’ll be savoring every cup! Read more | 5.0\nSo far, I've really enjoyed these coffee pods. The Variety Pack is a delight, offering different flavors for every mood. The Single Serve Pods are incredibly convenient - just pop one in and you're good to go. I particularly loved the Morning Blend Flavor; it's mild yet flavorful, perfect for starting the day. Definitely a high-quality set for coffee enthusiasts! Read more | 5.0\nI bought 4 boxes of 42 pods each. One box, batch# LC 101 052724 plugged my coffee maker almost ~75% of the time. I cleaned it each time, made sure the puncture device as clear. Again, almost all of them plugged my coffee maker, more than few times i had a sludge in the bottom of my coffee cup, and grounds floating in my coffee cup. One time, it completely dumped the entire contents of the pod into my coffee cup. Lots of sludge and grounds that time, the pod was totally empty of anything. This is the second time in a few years of buying these that this has happened. Hopefully the shipper can notify the quality assurance department of Victor Allen. A one off on occassion is one thing, but having 25-30 out of 42 is not a good thing and gets expensive. I also verified by buying a local brand, and they ALL worked just fine and made good coffee. One more time with Victor Allen and I will be done with them. Update on 1-23-2025, 5 out of 6 pods dumped grounds into my coffee cup today. Not looking too good. 02-06-25, I had a run of about 10 pods that were good, but now I am having them blow out again. 0 stars for this as I have read multiple reviews of people having the same issues with this brand. The company, Amazon nor VA seems to read these reviews and respond, so I am no longer buying their products, and will reiterate the 0 STARS for this product. Update 02-12-2025. Contacted Victor Allen direct via email, recieved a canned response requesting pics, sent pics, recieved 4 boxes 42ea. with an apology for dissatisfaction. I will see if these pods will be any better, but at least I recieved a response. Will update after I use the new ones. Read more | 3.0\nI really dig this coffee. I get the 4-variety pack. The only flavor I'm neutral on is the morning blend but I still drink it without any thought about it. The other 3 are great in my opinion. Excellent flavors.

    "reviews": "Hazelnut Vanilla Latte Caramel Mocha Click Coffee Protein Powder is a game-changer for my mornings. The Double Shot Espresso flavor is rich and smooth, giving me that much-needed caffeine kick without the bitter aftertaste. It’s packed with 16g of protein and 23 essential vitamins, so I feel energized and ready to tackle the day. Plus, it’s low in calories, which fits perfectly into my health goals. I love mixing it with almond milk for a creamy, satisfying drink. Whether you’re hitting the gym or just need a quick and tasty breakfast, this is a fantastic choice. Highly recommend for coffee lovers who want a healthier start to their day! Read more | 5.0\nEdit, I think years later.  Just a warning - it may be an anomaly but my order, first one for some time, never arrived and the refund was a bit of a hassle. Ended up ordering it from their website. But what I wrote below still holds - I love this stuff, especially made in a smoothie blender (and often with equal parts water and 2% milk).  Re the expense, for me it replaces both coffee and creamer plus whatever I'd eat for breakfast, plus a respectable portion of protein.  (+Most protein powers are very $ and I think nasty.) Add it up. And if you want more caffeine buzz just have cold coffee made up in the fridge and use it for part of the liquid (tho it's plenty strong for me.) I like it with frozen fruit, too - sort of a chocolate or caramel covered fruit deal.  (I never bother to make it hot any more, I like the cold latte/milkshake effect.) I only buy it when I want to knock off a little poundage, but it's crucial then. Just please alert others if the shipping issue is chronic. Previous: I decided to try this because I only love my coffee sweet, strong and very creamy, and calorie-wise it's choosing between coffee and breakfast. It's the one thing I haven't been able to give up and I've tried every skinny cream/creamer /sugar replacement on the planet.  Well, this stuff is really delicious to me and it's got nutrients so when dieting it can be coffee and brekkie in one. I've got my jo jazz and I feel full.  Brilliant invention.  If you make it hot (works fine per instructions) stir it as you drink - it's tasty but gets unpleasantly thick at the bottom. If you use a little smoothie blender instead of shaking it gets super frothy.  Perfect. Except for the little dark steaks which are freaky looking. I'm deciding it's undissolved coffee. Read more | 5.0\nI like that even tho I don't have shake right away, it still taste good. I love the vanilla latte flavor best! Read more | 4.0\nGreat breakfast! Caffeine and protein in one quick glass. When I’m needing to head out in the morning early and don’t have time to make a good breakfast, I can get food and go-juice and be gone. Oh, and it tastes very good, too! Nice chocolate flavor, no weird taste, like with some protein powders. Plus, it mixes well in a shaker with a wire mixing ball inside. I’ll be buying more. Read more | 5.0\nI usually like trying coffee flavored protein shakes to replace my real coffee in the morning. I’m extremely particular about my protein powder and tend to hate most of them. I’ll say that this was not bad but it wasn’t great either. I don’t think it had anything to do with the flavoring as much as it did with the consistency. The consistency is relatively thick, now I’m not sure if this is purely because I use milk instead of water. I even used a blender to see if I could thin it out but it didn’t work. I’m not a fan of thick shakes, especially protein shakes. I feel like it just doesn’t mix as easily as the ones I’ve had in the past. The flavor is strong and I actually like that for my coffee. Be mindful that you need to use 2 scoops (or 30g if you’re using a scale) to get the 16g of protein that is listed. This was the other thing, most protein shakes which are usually 32g per serving have around 24g of protein. I like that it comes in a cute little bag instead of a bin, just makes it easier to store. The price isn’t too bad, especially if you’re like me and like to switch protein shake flavors regularly. It’s definitely something that I’ll finish until the end but likely won’t re-purchase. I’ll have to check out their other flavors possibly. The consistency is really what’s holding me back but I’ll continue to experiment to see if I can fix that issue. Read more | 3.0\nI’ve been using all flavors of this product for quite a number of years now. It’s very tasty and personally I add a cut up frozen banana and a little peanut butter to the mocha and it makes an excellent protein shake for breakfast. You can even drink it hot if you like, but you have to mix it cold and then slowly put it in the microwave until it gets to your desired temperature. Give it a shot. I just wish they would go back to the old formula that had a decaffeinated option. Will continue to buy. Read more | 5.0\nSuper tasty when mixed with whole milk. Almost reminds me of a thick coffee ice cream just slightly melted. Quality of the powder is nice and it blends very easily with a electric mini mixer.

It doesn't have a horrible after taste or taste like a diet drink.  It does have a little after taste but it's bad.  It's has a comparable taste to slim fast coffee flavor.  At least in my opinion.  It's a thinner drink.  It's not thick at all.  It's perfect for on the go.  I think it would be good room temp.  I like it on ice.  I would take this in the car as a quick meal replacement or snack.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Mocha I love the taste and it sits well on my stomach. I have trouble with some protein shakes, but this is great Read more | 5.0\nI have been back and forth with low carb/protein shakes and foods for years. I typically cant stand the taste and end up stopping after a few months. This is delicious. I make 10oz of coffee, put a scoop in and stir. It tastes like hot chocolate more than coffee but I am ok with that. A little lumpiness but if you ever take hot chocolate packs and have little lumps from the powder it tastes the same and stays at the bottom. Just stir a few extra times and it'll go away. I also eat a piece of bacon or sausage with it so i don't feel like I'm drinking all my meals. This could be my solution to long term low carb. Fingers crossed. Read more | 5.0\nI love having the shake available on mornings I am running short on time. It does not have a chalky texture or taste like some others and provides the perfect amount of pick-me-up. I am only giving a 4 start because if you do not use a blender to mix it, it is difficult to get it to break down. Read more | 4.0\nI like this product. It blends into my coffee well and tastes great. Read more | 5.0\nVery bad sugar/over sweet taste. It does blend well but it tastes so bad that I can’t drink it. I buy naked whey double chocolate because it’s the only protein I can find without Splenda, monk fruit, stevia or any other artificial tasting sweetener and hoped this would be the same. It doesn’t taste like coffee or mocha, just sweet. Read more | 1.0\nThis is my most favorite! It doesn’t taste chalky, gritty or have that “protein” taste!! It’s very good quality, clean and tastes amazing Read more | 5.0\nTaste and flavor ok but way too sweet!! Read more | 3.0\nComes in handy as a quick hot chocolate drink. Taste great with 1.5 cups of milk, I used Fairlife non fat milk. It was easy on the stomach. It was a little clumpy but I have a tool that I use to blend it in to help with the clumpiness. Outside of that it was fine. Just got my second container in the mail. Would love if the servings were for about 25 servings versus 20 but I’d still order again. Great product Read more | 5.0",

There is a froth packet that makes a little froth, reminding me of the expensive coffee chains.  It is a little sweet, but not too bad.  Most brands of cappuccino are way too sweet for my taste, and for someone who used to drink plain black coffee, Gevalia has just the right amount of sweetness in it.  Unfortunately this cappuccino is hard to find in stores,  and if they do carry it, it's in a 6 pack and too expensive.  Target does still carry it in the 12 pack but I don't have a Target that's convenient to me. Read more | 5.0\nThis kit was not only flavorful but fun and easy to use. Read more | 5.0\nIn search of great latte's for my love, I ordered a small machine I thought would have cups that would give her the flavors she loved. This one was so strong she found it bitter, but I can possibly correct that by brewing a larger cup. In trying 8 0z, I will proceed to 12 oz and see. Will let you know if that raised her rating.  Are the suppliers of these companies considering people who like weaker coffee flavors and a fully mixed sweet latte that is delivered via the machine process. The brewing part works very well.

It was good and had a good flavor. Good value for the money. It’s keeping me going like I hoped. Good durability. It tasted smooth. The cinnamon flavor was good. Will buy again. I don’t have caffeine jitters after drinking it. Highly recommend! Update: 24 August 2024- I just wanted to say that I drink this coffee and I really love it a lot! It’s keeping me up and going! I will be buying this again. It’s smaller cans compared to other coffees I’ve bought, but it’s just enough. I don’t want a whole lot of coffee to drink. I find other brands are too much for me. I want something to open my eyes, give me energy and keep me going all day without sucking down great big cans or bottles. This is perfect! Read more | 5.0\nI always crave a fresh iced straight black coffee each morning and Every time, it's always too bitter or sour. BUT THIS COFFEE has managed to perfect the recipe to slightly sweeten black coffee just enough to not disrupt the dark flavor!! I pop one in my backpack before school each morning and it keeps me energized throughout classes. So Convenient and Sucha Cute packaging! It also goes well with ANYTHING>> Especially with sweet snacks, and the cold coffee balances out EVERYTHING. PLS keep this COFFEE stocked :)) I'm so excited to try the other flavors!! Read more | 5.0\nIgnoring the false advertising here, the coffee itself tastes pretty good, but in my opinion it's a bit too watery and not creamy like the Vietnamese lattes I've had in local cafes.

I won’t be buying them again. Read more | 3.0\nI'm not a big coffee lover, but I really enjoy this brand because the coffee is milder and sweeter, but not extremely sweet that it takes away from the coffee taste. I drink one basically every morning if I need to get up earlier or am just generally feeling tired; the caffeine in it is the perfect boost! It is super well-worth the price! Read more | 5.0\nSince it's Vietnamese Coffee, I was expecting the coffee flavor to be more intense, but to me, all I can taste is super super sweet oat milk and cinnamon. I always drink my coffee with creamer so I'm used to slightly sweet coffee, but this is way overboard and makes it undrinkable for me unless I treat it like a creamer for my cold brew coffee. Unfortunately it's not very smooth either...I don't know if it's due to the oat milk or cinnamon, but I physically feel stuff in my throat and develop a cough after I drink it.. Read more | 2.0",

My last subscription with the rainforest has been split into arrived early and arriving late. I no longer have anymore subscriptions with the rainforest and am reducing the rainforest to  source for when no other means available. Membership fee is a waste when all it provides is mishandled products, expired products misdelivered products and crushed products. The rain forest is only gotten worse with no more hope in sight. Update//// 11-8-24 Have had to change to the double shot because the triple shot comes with a little bit of clumps in it. The minim clumps is most likely the milk content coagulating do to exposure to heat during stocking shipping or delivery shipping. Haven’t had the same issue with the double shot cans. Prefer the taste of the triple shot but the lumpy texture is annoying. Product tastes so good I drink 2 a day.

    "reviews": "El Gallo Organic Breakfast Blend, WB House Blend, WB Frequency Blend, WB El Diablo, WB Black Cat Sublunar, WB Black Cat Analog Black Cat Classic Espresso, WB I'm not really a big coffee aficionado so I can't personally attest to the flavor profile. I did not see a roast date on my package which many people commented on in their reviews. The beans were not dried and shriveled up like on other reviews. I used 2 cups of beans which wasn't even half the bag, so hopefully this bag is good for a month of use in a 1 person/1.5 cups per day household. I mostly got this as a way to stop paying for the canned harbucks coffees in the stores which are absurdly costly and take time out of my week to get. 10$/mo is a lot better than 90$ for the cans. The cold brew did not produce a black color which shocked my coworker, but the flavor was very high after a short 11 hour brew. The flavor is significant dulled after a shot of milk and vanilla. Both my taste testers thought the coffee was great. Coffee grounds are great for composting (green material) and your coffee bean grinder can also grind dried disinfected eggshells. Read more | 5.0\nThese beans were delicious and fresh. I am extremely happy I tried these. It took a little to dial in at first as it was a little sour. I had to grind a little finer and pull a 1:2.5 ratio (18g in, 45g out) with a 30s bloom on my espresso and the flavor was magical! If you have the money, time, and patience to try this coffee, I strongly recommend it! Read more | 5.0\nI really didn’t want to believe the reviews so I ordered this coffee despite the bad reviews. We had this type of coffee in Chicago years ago and it was amazing. So amazing that I have never forgotten it. Unfortunately this is not the same thing and something is terribly wrong with these beans. There is literally zero flavor. With my normal coffee I usually use 5 scoops to make a 12oz batch. The first batch of Intelligentsia I used 5 scoops and it was literally like water. I tried 7 scoops and it’s still very bland- I can’t taste any underlying hints of flavor the way I could from our yummy Intelligentsia coffee in Chicago. Anyways, I’ve now made only a few pots and the whole bag is gone- wasted half of it trying to get it to be strong enough- and I won’t be buying again. Sidenote- the beans are BONE dry. Not sure if that could have anything to do with it but most coffee beans have a bit of oil residue to them. Do not recommend if you’re looking for true intelligentsia coffee. If you like hot tea, that’s basically what this will give you. Read more | 1.0\nPros: Very complex Rich Excellent for doubles and triples Cons: A bit expensive Merely adequate for singles Overall: I very much like Black Cat Espresso. I consider it the bar against which other espressos are measured. I like it more than Kicking Horse, Lavazza, and Stumptown. Its flavor profile is very complex. It has its fair share of caramel and chocolate, but it also has a spicy, savory nature to it, and very fruity notes that come out well in singles. This is not a large-scale, homogenized coffee. Different regions and roasts result in different flavors from each bag. Sometimes that spiciness becomes a sort of salty flavor, and the fruits can turn very flowery. It is an easy espresso to make. Even shots that aren't perfect come out tasting pretty good. It's also a forgiving blend in that the shots are not prone to channeling. Singles are good, because any good coffee becomes light and toasty in a single, as opposed to the rich, crema-bombs of doubles and triples. Still, this espresso is very much intended for doubles or triples. In drip coffee, it's alright. And by drip, I mean any immersion process, be it French press, Aeropress, drip, pour-over, etc. The flavors get blown out, with the spices overwhelming the chocolates and caramels and resulting in a coffee that's not terribly smooth. Of the immersion processes, Aeropress tasted the best, probably because it most closely approximates espresso. Black Cat is a bit expensive, but not terribly so. Especially when one considers the increases in coffee as of late, -even Starbucks Tribute was $14 per pound- the price isn't crippling, but it is definitely above many other brands. You can save a little money by buying in five-pound bulks on Intellgentsia's website, but it's not a good idea to keep coffee beans around for that long when you can just as easily get it fresh. All said, Black Cat is espresso that more often than not finds its way into my machine. UPDATE: Something that I forgot to mention in my initial review is that Black Cat is a very complex blend. That means that cheap stepped grinders WILL NOT grind the coffee correctly for espresso. Some higher-end stepped grinders will do the job, like the Rancilio Rocky, but you'll want a good, stepless grinder to fine-tune the grind. This is especially important if you have an espresso machine that's very picky about grind. Finally, this is not a terribly cremariffic espresso, which means to get a good amount of crema out of it, and thus really have a good canvas for latte art, you're going to have to prepare triples. UPDATE #2 ABOUT WEIGHT: It is very important to realize that the various sellers selling this are NOT SELLING THE SAME PRODUCT. The beans are the same, and most of the sellers are selling freshly-roasted beans. They are selling different weights, though. Need Caffeine is selling one-pound bags (16oz), whereas Trade Concepts and Abernook are selling 12oz bags for the same price. If different sellers than the above mentioned become available, e-mail the seller to ask the weight of the bag. It's the only way to ensure that you are getting a full pound. This is supposed to be the product page for the full-pound bag. That's why there is a separate product page for the 120z bag. I am very disappointed in Trade Concepts and Abernook. Read more | 4.0\nThis coffee is increadably smooth with chocolate overtones and an inherent sweetness!  We will be buying more of this! Read more | 5.0\nreviews of coffee are clearly subjective as people like different flavors, but I read the label speaking of \"dark chocolate, raw sugar and marshmallow\" and I was like \"sign me up!\". I, however, was not able to taste these flavor notes in my espresso. There were hints of dark chocolate, but i tasted way more lemon and heavy sour flavors. I was able to moderate this someone by using the finest setting on my bean grinder, but it only brought me up to thinking this coffee was 'so-so'. I think the beans were of a high quality and arrived fresh, so I'm going to try other blends from Intelligentsia with either a medium/dark or dark roast as a comparison. Read more | 3.0\nI’ve been using Lavazza dark roast for some time run through a Krups espresso and would adjust flavor with grind but, I recently purchased a G3(Marzocco) and there are various ways to “adjust” the intensity, aroma , flavor… with this machine. I still have a Barista  “Virtuoso” that’s going on 10 years(burr grinder) . Decided to try one of the many bean blends now available and roasted in house. You can now purchase a coffee bean roaster for your home but blending beans is the tricky part and uber retentive (at least in my part) but after several 12 ounce sampler pack I purchased here on Amazon , this one is my most favorite. It’s not an oily bean so don’t expect a lot of “crema”but , I can taste the chocolate , a little caramel and toasted brown sugar in my brew. Definitely will keep this one on my shelf !

    "reviews": "I'm a coffee lover.  My husband usually makes me coffee in my rushy mornings, but he travels a lot, so I liked the idea of the convenience of this easy and quick to make iced  coffee which already includes creamer and sweetener.  You only have to add 2 scoops in 6 ounces of water, mix, and it blends easily!  I have also tried it with coconut and almond milk, and the flavor is delicious! I can definitely taste the cinnamon coffee flavor. This has been a healthy coffee alternative that also gives me a boost! Read more | 5.0\nRealmente no me ayudó con lo del peso pero los primeros días me ayudó mucho con la digestión y también me ayudó a controlar los antojos entre comidas. Del sabor no está tan mal pero no fue del todo de mi agrado pero para mi la solución fue mezclarlo con mi proteína de vainilla y el sabor cambió y quedó riquísimo. Lo volvería a comprar solo porque siento que me ayudó bastante con el tema de los antojos. No me dio ningún tipo de dolor ni me provocó diarrea.

I love the convenience that you only need to add water because the sweetness and creamer is already included. It does calm the hunger in my stomach for about an hour but not the hunger in my head. For example, typically if I'm hungry and haven't eaten I'll get a headache. So if i drink this my hunger will be calmed but I'll still develop that hunger headache i get. This was a splurge though because it was a bit pricey. In the future when I make more money this will be a regular purchase. A thought I've had though is I feel if I'm hungry and I drink the normal cup of coffee I usually drink my hunger subsides for a while too... so does this really work?... um idk haha But for calories sakes and taste I love it! doesn't need milk or anything, just water!

Que decepción, jamás volveré a comprar de este proveedor a menos que me diera un refund o solucionara mi problema.

    "reviews": "I only do esspresso shots with a little bit of sweetness like adding condensed milk. Sometimes some soy but minimal like a traditional macchiato. I like my coffee on a more smooth, sweet taste and this hits the spot. I found this thru a subscription, and was happy finding this on here to buy. 2lbs seems like a lot but it’s worth it if you enjoy this coffee. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the Bark at the Moon dark roast coffee whole beans and was looking forward to as they describe - The rich flavors of dark chocolate and caramel drizzle coupled with a caramel-like aftertaste. This blend is the outdoor lover's dark roast. It captures the spirit of adventure with the fresh taste of the wild keeping you barking until the moon rises. Unfortunately, I can't do a review on that blend because I'm pretty sure that I received the other blend called Hell Yeah, medium roast beans. (See pictures of Front labels) Besides not tasting like the Bark at the Moon description, or looking like dark roast, the labels on the front of the bag represent the Hell Yeah blend. However, the label on the back indicates the Bark at the Moon blend (See picture). So, I will go ahead and review the Hell Yeah - medium roast that the product description states that it Tastes Like Swiss Chocolate, Macadamia Nut, Sweet, since I'm pretty sure that's what I got. Opening the bag for the first time, I got a good whiff of some nice smelling beans. Grinding them produced more pleasing smells. The first taste after brewing presented a nutty, smooth, full flavor taste. Didn't really detect a Swiss Chocolate flavor, although there were some undertones of another flavor but DEFINITELY NOT Dark Chocolate or Caramel as what was supposed to be in the coffee I ordered. It was VERY good tasting coffee, just not what I ordered. Will I order this again? Probably not, and as much as I would've LOVED to get the Bark at the Moon, I probably won't take a chance trying to order again and hope I get it the next time. Read more | 4.0\nIt smells so good when you grind it  and has a chocolate smell mixed with the smell of really good coffee. And it is really good. It's the kind of coffee that when you start drinking it like you normally would, maybe two or three good sips then set it down for a minute, you keep drinking it instead. before you know it there is none left in the cup. That's pretty much how it happened for me, and yeah it's really good coffee. But it's also 40 dollars which cost it a star. Read more | 5.0\nThe ultimate example of how much I enjoyed Drink Coffee Do Stuff's Bark at the Moon blend was two weeks ago when I had to wake up at 5am to be ready to register my daughter for pre-school next year...the program we are using opens their online registration very early and you want to be first in line to get everything submitted/completed as that can have some impact on if your kid gets into the program. This is usually not a pleasant experience as it entails typing endless pages of contact information, medical details and academic goals...but....I actually looked forward to rolling out of bed because I knew I had a pot of Bark at the Moon ready to go! The bag I got said it was roasted on 2/15 and I received several days after that...so this is some of the freshest coffee I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I thought that was really cool. I'm a fan of darker blends of coffee and Bark at the Moon certainly fits that category. The description professes it to have notes of dark chocolate, Carmel drizzle and be very rich...I for sure agree with the last two..the dark chocolate doesn't really come out for me that I can notice. I have actually also tried the \"Hell Yeah\" blend from this same company and you can very much taste a difference between the medium-ness of that and the darkness of the Bark at the Moon. The packaging the beans came in seemed high quality and let me rubber band it back up in between grinding beans. I use a Bodum burr grinder and the beans come out really nicely ground up/fine for my drip coffee maker (Technavorm Mochamaster). This morning I have a busy day so I ground up enough for two pots. Pictured are my cats inspecting the bag and my first cup of the morning. Great product! Read more | 5.0\nI think I can taste a bit of the chocolate notes. This coffee is very light, and I'm not a huge fan of dark roast but I'm glad I got dark roast. The beans are not oily at all and smell great. The first thing I noticed was that it was acidic and sour black. So I had it with my usual milk and honey and it just lacked the other notes and depth I'm used to. I do sense the sweetness of the coffee, I think it's not as bitter as I'd imagine dark roast to be. Great mild coffee, good with milk Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "We love this coffee! Read more | 5.0\nWhen I opened the package, the beans appeared to be very fresh. Not dried out at all, uniformly colored, with the right amount of slight oiliness. They ground up quite easily in my hand-crank grinder. Then I brewed via French press. The coffee is really good. There's a bitterness there, but I wasn't picking up on any acid flavor or acrid notes. The taste was well rounded, with some hints of sweetness and cocoa. I prefer a French roast, so this brew was right in line with my preferences. I wasn't a huge fan of the bag itself. I have a little scoop I use to measure my beans, and it wasn't the easiest fit through the resealable opening. And the resealer, well, it doesn't reseal the greatest, so hopefully the beans stay fresh. The company is based out of Lake Tahoe, which is a state away from me, so I like that I'm supporting a regional business. I'll keep an eye out for some of their other coffees. Read more | 5.0\nThe beans are fresh but they are too darkly roasted in my opinion. Could not taste the chocolate flavor or any sweetness, rather it’s quite bitter. Maybe it’s the patch I got? Not sure Read more | 4.0\nPretty good coffee. I do actually taste the chocolaty flavor. Will look into buying again Read more | 5.0\nThis is a wonderfully flavorful coffee that we quickly decided was our morning go-to.  It's unusual because we've tried several new coffees lately.  Both my wife and I found only good things to say about it.  She likes hers with a little creamer, and I mostly drink mine black.  This allows the great coffee taste to come through, even with creamer.  For me, it was mellow and smooth, with hardly any acidity.  The package tasting note of bittersweet chocolate had me a bit worried, as that's not my favorite.  Really, I didn't get that flavor myself.  It was straight delicious coffee.  That's exactly what we want. Read more | 5.0\nI really liked this coffee. It has a really bold flavor without the bitterness associated with dark roast coffees, Upon brewing I thought it was going to be on the bitter side but it wasn’t (has that bitter smell but doesn’t taste bitter). I find French roast to be a little darker than I typically like however, this was a mild French roast in my opinion, and was not too strong, but wasn’t light either.  The beans grind up easily, And I really appreciate the resealable bag.  This is definitely one of the better coffees I’ve tried, and I will continue to order this in the future. If you’d like French/dark roast coffee (On the lighter side of dark roast)  this is definitely one you should try. Read more | 5.0\nI love this coffee. It is whole beans that are fresh and you can grind them to match the preparation method.  I made French Press coffee, drip coffee, and espresso with a Breville bambino. All three were extraordinary. The resulting coffees were not bitter at all and seemed free of acid. Instead the cups of coffee were rich, smooth and had hints of chocolate. When I added cream it emphasized it - yum, milk chocolate.😁 This coffee makes a good cold coffee too. The leftovers did not get bitter! I also.like the package, Easy to open and easy to reseal. Try it! Read more | 5.0\nDRINK COFFEE DO STUFF, Tips Up Tahoe, Blend, Whole Bean, French Roast 3 1/2 stars rounded up to 4. This high altitude roasted French roast is a blend of unknown origin. The listing states the coffee is organic (and so does the white Amazon label on the bag because it just states the listing info), but that information is not listed on the bag itself. The beans arrived in an 11-ounce bag that has a narrower, resealable opening (pull tab to open). The seal works well, but it’s a little tight to get a tablespoon into that smaller opening. The beans had a visible sheen; they looked and smelled fresh. The beans were ground in our manual grinder and the coffee was brewed with our Keurig K-Café Smart machine and a Keurig Universal Reusable Coffee Filter filled almost to the max line. This was my first French roast coffee, and it had what I now know is the typical French roast taste (kind of charred) and a thin body; I couldn’t detect any of the tasting notes. I sampled the coffee plain, but I needed warmed, frothed soy milk to enjoy my cup. However, I now know that French roast isn’t my preferred coffee, so your mileage may vary. The bag I received in October 2023 was clearly marked “Best By 08 23 24”. “Roasted in Lake Tahoe”. Read more | 4.0",

We don't have plug in machines at our disposal. We need an instant coffee that we can add hot water to that is outstanding. Get it???? Death Wish did it. In an outstanding way. It is delicious. High caffeine. Not like some of the leading \"drive through\" packets. They are terrible. This coffee is not only delicious, but I swear it has a chocolate undertone. So good. :)))))) So whether you are at work with some creamer and sugar add-ons, or on a camping trip in the middle of nowhere....You can make the very best cup of coffee you can. And hello....Oh my Goodness...without a Keurig machine. Who thought? Read more | 5.0\nThese packets of Death Wish instant coffee are strong. Make no mistake about it – these will get you going in the morning. I only need one cup and I’m good for the rest of the day. I’m not crazy about the taste because it is, understandably, quite strong and even after adding a little sugar and creamer, it’s still bitter, in my opinion. I know many find the taste to be smooth and satisfying, but I’m not a coffee connoisseur and I’ve never been crazy about the taste of coffee, in general. I’m just someone that finds high caffeinated coffee a good and more natural solution when I need a quick pick-me-up versus a Red Bull or Monster energy drink. I used to purchase these in my local Wallymart, but they don’t stock them anymore, so I was happy to find them on Amazon and they arrived on time and appropriately packaged. I don’t drink this on a daily basis because I need to watch my blood pressure and I don’t want my body to develop a tolerance, but when I’m really dragging, this does the trick. I also love this for the convenience of the instant packets. You can literally take these anywhere, so they’re prefect for traveling. I recently took a trip to South Korea and the jet lag after a 15-hour flight was brutal. These were just what I needed to get acclimated to the time change. I’m definitely a repeat customer. Read more | 5.0\nWow, I just tried Death Wish Coffee Instant Coffee Dark Roast and I have to say, I'm pleasantly surprised. I was skeptical of the bold claims of an \"extra kick of caffeine\" and being an \"intense blend of Arabica & Robusta beans,\" but this coffee truly delivered. The USDA organic powder was a nice touch, ensuring that I'm not putting any harmful chemicals or pesticides into my body. And let's talk about the caffeine content – a whopping 300mg for a day lift! As someone who needs a strong cup of coffee in the morning to wake up, this was a game-changer. The single serve packets also make it incredibly convenient to bring with me on-the-go or to the office. The taste was also excellent – full-bodied with hints of chocolate and caramel. I'm so glad I took a chance on Death Wish Coffee Instant Coffee Dark Roast. It's a great alternative to traditional coffee and I highly recommend giving it a try.

And they are very easy to use, as they come in individual packets, which is great to through in a bag for work if your office coffee is terrible or if you travel. I do not care for the flavor, but my husband and daughter like them. My husband takes a few with him when he travels. They do have a lot of caffeine if you are in the market for that.

Only thing I wish it had is nootropics for focus when studying! Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the Plant Press - Passionfruit Peach - Organic Clean Caffeine Energy Drink & Coffee Alternative, and I must say, it's a delightful find! The taste of this drink is truly enjoyable, making it a refreshing choice for a caffeine boost.

The drink provides just the right amount of clean energy without the jitters or crash that can come with coffee or other caffeinated beverages.

It provides a satisfying experience at a reasonable price point, making it an excellent choice for those seeking a quality beverage without breaking the bank. Personally, I found the Plant Press - Passionfruit Peach - Organic Clean Caffeine Energy Drink & Coffee Alternative to be a fantastic option.

Read more | 5.0\nI had to quit Celsius due to all the crap ingredients in it so I was on the search for something clean. A client of mine is an investor in this company and recommended it. Took me some time to adapt to the flavors cause I was so used to the chemicals in Celsius lol but now I love it! So good and so much better for my gut health! I just wish delivery didn’t take so long. Read more | 5.0\nI used this for my pre work out and I felt like it gave me a quick boost to get a good workout in. I loved the ingredients and that they all all clean, no artificial sweeteners or colors. I do wish it had a slightly better taste, maybe I just have a bit of a sweet tooth, so I like it a little sweeter lol Read more | 4.0\nThis drink is perfect! Light taste and does the job. Had to get off Celsius because of the harmful Nuro toxins!! The ingredients in this drink are much healthier!! Plant press doesn’t have a high sugar content but taste delicious!! I have bought several cases and will continue to purchase them!! Read more | 5.0\nI was trying to be a little more healthy with half the caffeine as other energy drinks.  I only drink them once in a while.  If I could give this zero stars I would.  It’s really sour, kind of reminds me of watermelon rind.  Hardly any flavor.  I do not recommend this flavor.  Don’t waste your money. Read more | 1.0\nI first saw this drink while I was shopping at an upscale grocery store near my house and needed some caffeine so I picked it up and gave it a try- am so glad I did because I loved it and have already ordered two cases on Amazon since then!! It's such a great alternative to Redbull and Celsius, which I think taste like you're drinking chemicals. Plant Press is now my go-to when I am feeling tired but not in the mood for coffee. And with all the vitamins in there I feel like it's totally fine to skip my daily multi-vitamin :) highly recommend trying this if you're looking for a clean-tasting and healthy way to get some caffeine!!

Read more | 4.0\nWeak coffee Read more | 1.0\nRoasted in Lake Tahoe this medium-roast whole bean coffee according to information on the company’s site is a blend of 60% Honduras Pacayal Honey and 40% Peru Aproeco. The coffee is stated to be sweeter less bitter and after brewing a pot I agree with that description. I used a burr grinder on a medium setting for brewing in a quality automatic drip machine that allows the temperature to be set (I used 188F degrees) and intensity (I selected bold). The resulting brewed coffee was lightly sweet and well-balanced with a light note to acidity and bitterness that individually are not noticeable and together create complexity. These things are objective but this is a coffee that I could drink all day. To estimate shelf-life of the 11 ounce re-sealable pouch is 12 months in the future but dates will vary. After opening the coffee should be used promptly. Read more | 5.0",

Read more | 5.0\nI recently purchased the ReadyWise Freeze-Dried Meal Bucket and have been thoroughly impressed with the variety and convenience it offers. As someone who faces challenges with food preparation due to executive dysfunction, this bucket has been a game-changer for ensuring I have nourishing meals without the stress of cooking. The selection of meals included in the bucket is impressive and covers a wide range of flavors and options. From the savory Southwest Beans and Rice to the comforting Tomato and Basil Soup, each meal has provided a delicious and satisfying experience. I appreciate the thoughtfulness of including both breakfast and main meal choices, making it versatile for any time of day. One standout feature is the ease of preparation. Rehydrating the meals has been a breeze, requiring only water and a short waiting time. This convenience has been a lifesaver for most, if not all of my meals. I don't have a food preparation service near my home, so this was the next best thing. In addition, it has helped me portion control and help with my IBS, because it replaced my diet of frozen pizzas and various other \"fast\" junk food. Overall, I have no problem with the purchase. The only meal I don't prefer is the Tomato and Basil. I complemented this bucket with a bucket of fruit to help balance the nutrient value. The freeze-dried fruit blends have been a delightful addition to my meals. The burst of natural flavors and the nutritional benefits they provide have made each meal more enjoyable and well-rounded. While convenience is paramount for me, I've also been pleasantly surprised by the quality of the meals. The textures and flavors have exceeded my expectations for freeze-dried food, and I haven't encountered any unpleasant aftertastes or artificial flavors. The ReadyWise Freeze-Dried Meal Bucket has become an essential part of my meal planning, whether for quick on-the-go options or for emergencies. The peace of mind it provides is invaluable, knowing that I have a variety of wholesome meals at my fingertips. In summary, I highly recommend the ReadyWise Freeze-Dried Meal Bucket to anyone seeking a convenient, flavorful, and balanced meal solution. It's a fantastic way to ensure you're well-prepared for various situations, and it's a game-changer for individuals like me who face challenges with food preparation.

However, I believe the quality and convenience of this product would be valuable for anyone looking for hassle-free meal options.

(Amazon Prime Free Shipping..) I also have emailed with people at Wise FOods actual Company and they have talked to me about their food and Also Sent me a 4serv Sample for my family to try. When we made the packet we were kind of surprised at the food and how much it made. I have eaten many MRE's for weeks at a time and when I tried the Wise Food sample I was very surprised at how it tasted, way better than some of th MRE's I have eaten in the past. I cannot speak for all of their food but the packet I had was not too bad, it tasted kind of like cup of noodles. As far as the taste, it was not horrible, it was better than some MRE's I have tried, but if you are comparing it to food that we have now of course you would not want to eat the food instead of what we think of as our \"normal food\". So when people say wow this food is horrible, it is not far to compare this to the food that we have available to us now, you have to have a mindset of wow if I had Absolutely Nothing to eat if there was an emergency or even the end of the world haha, then would you want to starve to death? or would you want to try and eat scraps of whatever you could find? NO, You WOuld Be Very Happy to have this long term survival food that you would be able to eat and survive on!! If you would have to eat this food in a survival situation you would be very happy with how the food tastes then, You Would Be Happy to have a Hot Meal and you would NOT be B*******, at how bad this tastes, if you had no other food it would taste amazing. So when you judge the taste of the food you should judge it as if you had absolutely nothing else to eat, and at a shelf life of up to 25 years, this is a much better option than buying other canned goods that you have to rotate every couple of years... When I recieved my bucket, (I ordered one 84 serv bucket) I was Very Surprised at how small the bucket actually is! I am kind of mad that I read that some of the servings inside the bucket are actually 4 serv bags, but even that is not all that bad because it will not go bad in a day or how every long it takes yo uto eat it, so thats not that big of a deal, but verall I am happy with this purchase and I will be buying more, I am happy with the amazing customer service I recieved from the actual company Wise, they emailed me told me to ask them if I had any questions, and they had a 4serving bag sent out within a week for my family to sample. This type of emergency food storage is an awesome idea to have in case of any emergency, and at 25yrs of shelf life, you cant get any better than that!!! Read more | 5.0\nVery cool.

WHY WOULD WE EVER CREATE INSTANT MUSHROOM COFFEE? — We love organic instant coffee, but it has its downsides. We took 250mg of organic Lion's Mane powder (per serving), a functional, nootropic mushroom, which has been used around the world for centuries for increased focus and creativity, and combined it with our delectable, fair trade, organic coffee powder. This unparalleled pairing means no jitters, and hours of crash-free FOCUS.    RISE AND REALLY, TRULY SHINE — Each cup of instant mushroom coffee contains 250mg of wild-harvested, organic Chaga.

    "reviews": "High Dose Focus Latte (30 Serving Bag) High Dose Focus Coffee (30 Serving Bag) Focus Instant Coffee (30 Serving Bag) Protect Instant Coffee (10 Packets) Balance Instant Coffee (10 Packets) Focus Instant Coffee (10 Packets) As a health enthusiast, I’m thrilled to share my thoughts on the Four Sigmatic Organic Mushroom Coffee Singles with Lion’s Mane and Chaga! 🍄☕ Flavor and Enjoyment First off, let’s talk about taste. I wholeheartedly agree with you – this coffee blend is a delightful treat! The combination of Arabica instant coffee, Lion’s Mane mushroom, and Chaga mushroom creates a rich, earthy flavor profile. It’s like a cozy hug for your taste buds. 😋 Cognitive Boost Now, let’s dive into the health benefits. Lion’s Mane mushroom is renowned for its potential cognitive-enhancing properties. It contains compounds that may support brain health, memory, and focus. As someone who values mental sharpness, incorporating Lion’s Mane into my daily routine has been a game-changer. Whether I’m tackling work tasks or diving into a good book, I feel more alert and focused. Chaga Magic Chaga mushroom, another star ingredient, is packed with antioxidants. These little powerhouses help protect our cells from oxidative stress. Plus, Chaga has been traditionally used to support overall well-being. So, sipping on this coffee feels like a double win – satisfying my caffeine cravings while nourishing my body. Midday Pick-Me-Up I love your idea of using it as a midday treat! Instead of reaching for sugary snacks or another cup of regular coffee, I brew up a cup of Four Sigmatic’s magic elixir. The subtle energy boost from the caffeine, combined with the adaptogenic properties of the mushrooms, keeps me going without the jitters. Sharing the Love And kudos to you for introducing this to your 80-year-old mother! It’s heartwarming to know that she’s benefiting from it too. As we age, maintaining cognitive function becomes even more crucial, and Lion’s Mane can be a valuable ally. In summary, Four Sigmatic’s Organic Mushroom Coffee Singles are a delightful addition to any health-conscious person’s pantry. It’s not just coffee; it’s a wellness ritual. So, here’s to mental clarity, tasty brews, and happy sipping! 🌟🍵 My own Disclaimer: Always consult with a healthcare professional before adding new supplements or foods to your routine, especially if you have any underlying health conditions. 🌿 Read more | 5.0\nI bought this to help me have sustained energy and focus better at work. I have recently given up drinking energy drinks. I also have adult ADHD and this really does help me to be able to get my work completed while staying on task and not tiring out. I mix a packet in with my regular coffee to boost it up a bit. I only sip on my coffee on and off throughout my shift so the caffeine intake is pretty low since I only do one cup today compared to what I was doing with the energy drinks. I don't get the jitters and I don't get a caffeine crash. I can definitely feel a difference when I use the think powder opposed to when I don't. It seems to even help with my mood. Honestly I have become hooked on the way it makes me feel. It is not a psychedelic mushroom in any way but the nootropic effects are evident. I think that this works even better than the supplement pills that I have tried. It does not taste like mushrooms but it does have an earthy savory kind of taste. I have also mixed this with my cocoa and it heightened the flavor which was actually quite delicious! If you're going to add it to a cold drink I would suggest mixing it with just a little bit of hot water first because it doesn't seem to dissolve as nicely in cold beverages as in hot ones. You can drink it on its own without mixing it and something else. I'm sure it would taste just fine that way as well. I wish that they would sell a box that includes more packets because it seems like I am buying it every week but would prefer to just buy a large box. The packets are much easier for me to use because they're already pre-measured and easy to take with me on the go. If you are on the fence about buying this just try it and I'm sure you'll be glad that you did! Read more | 5.0\nThis was initially sent to me by my best friend as a gift for my birthday.  She knows I like \"elixirs\" and treat my body to whole foods, mostly plant-based, so this was a \"winner\"...not some frilly thing that will sit around and collect dust, but something I could \"instantly\" (pun intended), open and enjoy!  I like it so much in fact, I have since purchased another box and signed up for \"subscribe and save\" at two boxes per month.  So, I'm sold, for now, but I would like the company to consider some changes.  Here are my additional thoughts on the pros and cons... Pros:  All of the ingredients are organic and if I'm understanding the marketing correctly, \"wild\".  With the marketing term \"Wildcrafted\" on the box, I have this vision of someone with organic dirt under their fingernails out foraging the damp forest bed for wild mushrooms, but I'm thinking that might just be some crafty subliminal messaging on Four Sigmatic's part.  Good job, FS!  :)  I'm all about the phytochemicals, so this product is right up my alley!  God gave us plants for enjoyment, health and healing...for this I am so incredibly grateful!  It makes me a little giddy to make this my \"coffee of choice\".  Pricing...when compared to a Starbucks coffee, for example (which is total dung -- why do people drink that?), the price is decent I suppose.  The flavor is incredibly smooth and not the least bit acidic!  This is likely my favorite feature of the product.  I am not an instant coffee kinda girl.  I have always brewed my own shade-grown, organic coffee, so a product that is \"instant\" would have to be good, really good, to entice me to switch!  This product has done that!  There is the convenience factor -- it literally takes me about a minute and a half to boil 8 ounces of alkaline water.  I'm a flavor junkie so while the water is reaching a boil I really punch up each packet of the mushroom coffee mix with the addition of raw, unfiltered honey, raw cacao, Ceylon cinnamon and a shot of grass-fed butter or organic heavy whipping cream in the bottom of my mug.  I mean seriously, with those added, we're talking pure delight!  It's a daily \"event\" for me!  I am super-sensitive to the effects of caffeine and I have never, ever felt jittery using this product.  In fact, I've had a rather pleasant side effect that I can only attribute to use of this product.  I struggle with anxiety, yet interestingly, on the days when I drink this, I feel a sense of calm, I would describe as \"woosah\" because no other word seems to do the feeling justice.  It's almost like the calm I feel from taking magnesium. Cons:  So, back to the packaging for a moment.  It definitely falls in the convenience category...I mean, what's easier than tearing a packet open and dumping the contents into hot water, mixing, and drinking?  However, I do have some gripes about the packaging.  I would MUCH rather have this coffee elixir available loose in a tin of some sort that allows me to measure it out myself.  Each time I throw away a packet (sometimes 7 or more a week) I find it a bit ridiculous (and annoying).  The packet could (and should IMHO) be a paper product, rather than a plastic packet (I'm not certain it's plastic, but it does feel and look \"plasticy\").  The cardboard box that the ten packets arrive in always gets to me crushed (except on the rare occasion it is shipped in a box, rather than a shipping envelope).  It does not affect the integrity of the packets, but it does render the box unusable.  Again, the packets are convenient, and do have their place (like taking them on-the-go), however, for most daily home or office use situations, I would much rather have a bulk bin.  The product is a little on the pricey end when you consider the cost of each component separately.  I mean, I'm all for capitalistic America and making a profit, but it does seem a bit extreme of a profit margin.  My final gripe is more of an annoyance than anything else.  On the packaging it reads, \"BELIEVE IT OR NOT, THIS TASTES LIKE COFFEE.\"  You don't say?  I would imagine it does since it's 80%+ coffee.  I get it, more marketing, but still...it's just annoying. So, in a nutshell:  It's convenient, it's smooth and delicious but please work on getting the price down a bit with bulk-dose packaging.  I want a bulk option to measure out myself!  Get that fixed and I'll gladly throw all FIVE STARS your way!  Thanks, Four Sigmatic, for introducing such a great product into the marketplace and for educating folks on the power of the 'shroom!

    "reviews": "0.93 Ounce (Pack of 1) 1 Count (Pack of 8) Via is a Go-To for coffee on the trail.  No muss, no fuss, easy as boiling water, suitable for any vessel you prefer to carry along to drink from.  Yes, there is great pour-over for the trail, there are \"fresher and better\" ways to make coffee, and there are emerging competitors for \"instant coffee on the trail\", but Starbuck's has led the way for simplicity and ultra light weight, ultra compact in the pack, and yet ultra flavorful coffee with its Via Instants. For a robust flavor, both the Italian and French Dark roast offer that smoky, toasty flavor at less caffeine , typical of dark roast.  If you enjoy donut coffee, or need the caffeine in your morning cup, stick to the Via medium, which is very flavorful and balanced.  Which Via to choose?  Personal preference... give each a try... maybe then carry some of each and tailor your coffee by time of day or how you feel.  After all, a packet weighs nothing and takes no space... until its 3 times a day for a week or two, but even then some find space for this comfort. Read more | 5.0\nMy husband and I go backpacking a lot and so we have to really consider what we bring in terms of necessity and weight. Coffee is one of those things that is a MUST when we're on the trail. We can't start our day without a hot cup of joe. Unfortunately, when you're on the trail, we don't get the luxury of carrying around a nice percolator or basically any type of fancy coffee making equipment. All we have is a mini portable hand stove and a small kettle. This is where VIA Instant coffee comes in handy. These little packets are GOLD. These just-add-water-microgrounds are as close as it gets to fresh coffee. The flavor is bold and strong with a touch of sweetness. I love how easy it is to make -- just add a packet to boiling water and there you have it. It's very portable and lightweight so it doesn't add too much weight to your pack. My only criticism is how much packaging and trash these produce. I wish the packaging was made out of a biodegradable paper material, but I understand it's packaged to stay fresh.

They are great for when you have no other coffee, or to add to weak coffee at restaurants (that's how I use them most). Once I had no access to hot water and added it to a bottle of cold water.

She loves these both for the convenience and the taste. I can't imagine drinking instant coffee but it makes her happy.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Chocolate Caramel Cafe Latte I really like  this drink!  It fills you up and keeps you feeling full for hours ! It tastes really good! No chalky taste! It's a nice size bottle and sealed nicely! Thank You! Read more | 5.0\nMy boys are always looking for a quick on the go snack or meal and tend to grab a bar of some sort.  You can only do that so often before you get tired of them.  They are very health conscious and look for things with a large amount of protein to fill them up.  I ran across these premiere protein shakes and thought \"wow, why hadn't I thought of these before!\"  They make protein shakes all the time, if they have the time, but these would be so much easier!  My kids are pretty simple and like the basic flavors so I thought we would try the vanilla first. My kids absolutely love these.  These are a perfect size for on the go and not only fit in the palm of your hand but also fit in a cup holder perfectly.  They have a resealable screw on top which is nice.  The vanilla taste is amazing and very similar to vanilla ice cream like shown on the package.  They are similar to milk but a tad thicker.  There is zero powdery texture or grittiness and no bad after taste like some have.  These have 30 grams of protein so are very filling and 1 definitely fills you up.  The number of vitamins and minerals is amazing with only having 1 gram of sugar and 160 calories.  That's awesome!  I also love that they can rinse them easily and they can be recycled.  These are absolutely amazing in our household for so many reasons and my kids love them! Read more | 5.0\nI try not to rely on RTD protein shakes too much, but Premier Protein is one of my go to brands when I need one. They are very low in sugar (sweetened with sucralose (Splenda) and ace-k) which make them a good fit for keto/low carb diets. They are milk protein based, so they are creamy with no chalky pea/plant protein aftertaste. The caramel flavor isn't overly sweet or artificial tasting to me. It's best served cold in my opinion, but I also enjoy it as a creamer replacement in coffee (hot or iced) to add a protein boost. They keep fine in the fridge for a couple days, so you can use a couple ounces at a time. This case of 6 bottles came with an expiration date about 10 months out which should be enough to try them. If you drink these regularly, I'd recommend a larger quantity case for better value per bottle/serving. Read more | 5.0\nIt's good, no chalky feel or taste. I mix it with ice and a double shot of espresso. No need for cream or sugar. I'm not happy that there is fake sugar in it. Read more | 4.0\nI am trying to work a little more protein in my diet and these work really well for that purpose.  I am a cold coffee drinker and I use these high protein shakes in place of coffee creamer.  I usually get 4 coffees out of each bottle, which adds about 7.5g of protein to my day without even really trying or needing to think about it.  I got the caramel flavor and it is excellent.  I appreciate that the texture is creamy and there is no chalkiness or grit. Read more | 5.0\nThis protein drink truly excels in both taste and value. Offering the best bang for your buck, it delivers over 30 grams of protein while keeping the calorie count to just 160. The caramel flavor is delightfully light yet satisfyingly sweet, reminiscent of a milkshake when served ice cold. The drink is smooth and creamy, with no gritty texture that is often found in powdered protein drinks. Conveniently packaged in a bottle, it's perfect for on-the-go consumption, making it an ideal choice for busy individuals seeking a quick and nutritious option. Unlike some other protein drinks that leave an unpleasant aftertaste, this one maintains a clean, smooth finish, ensuring a pleasant drinking experience from start to finish. Whether you're enjoying it post-workout or as a mid-day snack, this protein drink is an outstanding choice for anyone seeking a flavorful and effective protein supplement. Its great taste, high protein content, low calorie count, and absence of any unpleasant aftertaste make it a standout product in the crowded market of protein drinks. Read more | 5.0\nI love these protein shakes. I have been drinking protein shakes on and off for a few years now. After trying all of the big name brands I keep coming back to premier protein. Most other brands will only produce powder and the other premade shakes aren’t as healthy and don’t taste as good. I got the chocolate and vanilla and both are great! Chocolate is my go to for a lunch time shake because it gives me my sugar craving fix around lunch time. Vanilla I use more for mixing into things like coffee and smoothies. I like adding the vanilla to coffee because it eliminates the need for creamer or milk and give the coffee a nice sweet flavor. I can usually stretch these to 3 cups of coffee per one shake or 2 cups and I have some leftover for lunch. This is the first time I’ve had their “grab n go” bottles compared to the milk carton style im used to having. I see no difference between to two. These are pricey but worth it for weight loss and meal replacements. Read more | 5.0\nPremier Protein Shake, Caramel, 30g Protein 1g Sugar 24 Vitamins Minerals Nutrients to Support Immune Health, 11.5 fl oz (Pack of 6) is an easy, tasty way to boost your protein intake. It tastes good and with 30g of protein, this drink offers more protein than most other bottled shakes. Make sure you refrigerate it before consuming as it tastes best ice cold. My issue is with the sucralose. I'm not a fan of artificial chemical sweeteners and sucralose is at the top of my no list. Truth be told, the whole shake is nothing but chemical soup. The convenience of having this shake ready to go, the variety of flavors and the enormous amount of protein is probably why they are so popular. but I think I'll stick to making my own protein smoothies. Value is average for this type of product. Read more | 3.0",

I have trouble with regular coffee giving me acid reflux and I'm so happy I found these.  I can make iced cold brew like you buy in a jar at the store for $1.00 for one of these pods and up to 3 espresso shots.  I have found that if I shake these before I use them there is less chance that there will be very much chocolate left in the pod after the water goes through it. Read more | 5.0\ngood flavor it does taste a little bland but I did make a 10 oz cup so it’s probably best to make a 8 oz for more flavor also add MILK makes it way better Also I thought I only ordered 20 but the package came with 80 lol it only charged me for 20 so that’s a plus for me hopefully it happens to you guys as well Read more | 5.0\nTasty, almost to good Read more | 5.0\nThis is my favorite coffee drink so I was very happy to find them on Amazon  The taste is a little sweet but very much like the ones you order at McD’s.  You need to make them in a 12-16 oz stainless steel cup, filling the cup about halfway with ice first.  After brewing, I let the ice melt for 5 minutes and the diluted drink is the perfect sweetness for me, but I have also added a bit of plain coffee and that worked well, too.  I think these would taste good warm, too.  At 80 calories these are a perfect pick-me up! Read more | 4.0\nThis is just a novelty with no substance to make it worthwhile. You don't need a specialized k-cup to make an iced drink. When you make this drink the pod is empty because all of the powder is dissolved - something you can do with hot water and a spoon, instead you have yet another plastic k-cup in our landfills. As for taste, the chocolate is like the cheap Easter basket chocolates that crumble and taste more like a choco-malt or something you could get by giving a child who doesn't know good chocolate.

    "reviews": "If you like sweetened coffees that are reminiscent of a Frappuccino - but are hot - the Unha's Asian Snack Store Korean Instant Coffee Variety Mixes are a good instant coffee pack to consider. The coffees are definitely not like a fresh cuppa, but given you only need to add some hot water and you're ready to go, I'd say that they're an instant win for your mornings. The individual coffee packets are small - it requires 4 ozs to make each packet, which is only 1/2 cup. You could add more water, but you will end up with a much weaker cup of coffee. Because I usually drink coffee black, I found these coffees to be nice as a morning treat as opposed to a \"wake me up\" blend. If you want a good caffeine jolt, I found adding an additional spoon of plain instant coffee balances the sweetness and adds the additional caffeine I need to wake up.  The flavors of the packs were not bitter and honestly reminded me of coffee candy. While there were six different varieties and two different brands, the flavors were honestly quite similar.  They all tasted like milky coffee and while some have a slight taste of vanilla or hazelnut, it wasn't pronounced like adding a glug of Torino's flavored syrup to your cup. At $0.39 per cup of coffee (well, 1/2 cup aka 4 ounces of coffee), this isn't likely to be a coffee I would go out of my way to get again, but if someone offered this to me, I definitely wouldn't turn it down either. Overall, it's a quick and convenient treat to make that will give you a minor jolt of caffeine when you need it.

Read more | 5.0\nDoesn’t wake you up. Doesn’t taste too strong. Quick to make, a great personal size. Its quality is amazing and it works in lower temperatures than a rolling boil. The taste is phenomenal but for a real kick you’ll want like 3 sachets rather than one. It works best with a rolling boil though.

Read more | 5.0\nPerfect for me like small coffees 3oz perfecr amount Read more | 5.0\nTaste as expected, little disappointed that I have to use 2 or 3 packs to get a full cup. Read more | 3.0\nThis is Korean coffee and, remember, they LOVE Americanos! So, as expected, these are MILD in flavor and only make 1/2 cup by American expectations. However, they are good and a quick fix when you need one. I did not expect a robust coffee flavor and am satisfied with the quality. Shipper was great! No complaints. If American, understand the differences in our expectations of coffee and you'll be fine. Read more | 5.0\nThis is good coffee.  Its quick and convenient!

    "reviews": "The tastes are a bit on the intense side, though not unpleasant. The overall result is a good tasting product that gives a soft increase in energy and a positive outlook toward the day.  :) Read more | 5.0\nAt first it tastes like a terrible attempt at a “healthy” energy drink. Then it kinda grows on you, as far as taste. I drink one of these every weekday morning and I can say after 3 weeks, I feel amazing. I feel faster and my sharp mentally. I’m in a much better mood throughout the day. I’d say it’s worth a try. Read more | 5.0\n10/10 low sugar no jitters only 85mg of caffeine tastes amazing and fantastic quality. Read more | 5.0\nFirst these are not high caffeine drinks... the energy comes from mushrooms... And no not the psychedelic ones.  The energy is clean and you feel motivated to do things, it isn't edgy and I don't get jitters after drinking it.  There is also a noticeable mood lift and a sense of happiness comes over you... Not overly euphoric like a drug... just you all of a sudden realize that you feel like smiling more. The effects last about 5 to 6 hours and fade gently so it is not a sudden drop off or crash... but you just gradually notice that the effect is not as strong.  But the mood elevation lasts longer, in my opinion.  Again, this isn't magic mushrooms and not Monster or Redbull.  But if you like a cleaner energy and maybe a mood pickup... then they are worth a try. Only reason I am giving them 4 out of 5 stars is price... They are expensive, so I only take these ever once in a while. Read more | 4.0\nI was really excited to try the Odyssey Elixir variety pack due to its unique blend of adaptogenic mushrooms and natural-sounding ingredients. Unfortunately, the taste was a major letdown. Each flavor seemed overwhelmingly artificial, almost chemical-like, and lacked the refreshing, fruity profile I was expecting. Despite its appealing branding and promises of cognition and energy support, the unpleasant taste made it difficult to finish even one can. If you're sensitive to artificial flavors or expect a natural fruit taste, this might not be the product for you. While I appreciate the concept behind the drink, the execution left much to be desired. Read more | 1.0\nBad taste. Seems to have positive impact though on energy. Read more | 3.0\nGreat energy and focus drink! Works like a charm, and tastes lovely. I’m not the biggest fan of the blackberry lemonade, but even that is decent! The others are great. Not sweet but sweet enough. Definitely recommend. Read more | 5.0\nI am a fan of Monsters, but I had heard some things about about Lion's Bane Mushroom extract and wanted to try a product with that ingredient.  I tried this product, even though it thought it seemed over priced. After 5 days of drinking 1 a day, I am completely disappointed. The taste of the various flavors is tolerable, not good, but tolerable. What is more important to me, is that I noticed no improvement in energy or ability to focus. Nothing. A cup of tea is more effective and costs less.  I would not recommend, and will not buy again. Read more | 2.0",

    "reviews": "Great coffee and awesome taste! I do not even crave the sugary creamer I used before! Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nSo, I've been on keto for 6 months now - Long enough to test a bunch of keto snack and drinks - And wanted to give myself some help in getting all those mcts etc etc Let me start by saying, I don't drink coffee regularly. But sometimes, for some random reason, I'll get a craving for it. --- I really, REALLY like this stuff. And so, I have been drinking it regularly for the last month and a half lol I have only gotten the caramel macchiato flavor so far. To be honest, I can't taste the caramel, and I have no idea what a macchiato is or what it's supposed to taste like. BUT what I do taste is very good. It has just enough included sweetener to take out the face-puckering bitterness of black coffee, which is EXACTLY the way I like it. I repeat, this coffee is NOT sweet per say. And it mixes amazingly. NO grit at the bottom of the cup, NO floating particles, NOTHING. Every other keto drink mix manufacturer should learn from this company. I mightily applaud them I will be ordering more. And, though the caramel macchiato doesn't taste, to me, like anything but not-so-bitter coffee, I will continue ordering only this flavor just because of my own personal laziness in not wanting to have to add my own sweetener to it (I acknowledge that this is a little pathetic on my part) But still, I thoroughly enjoy this stuff! There are, if I remember, 15 servings per container - 2tbsp per 8oz mug. I use an 11oz mug. And with 2tbsp, the drink is a little on the hefty/thick side (which I like) I just can't imagine going down to less liquid, because I think that might be a little TOO hefty. I have also bought this brand's keto creamer - which is also good. But I prefer the coffee with a big splash of heavy cream instead I don't think you can go wrong with this brand. It seems like they really know what they're doing. Read more | 5.0\nTakes some time to adjust to the taste if you're like me and need sugar and creamer to enjoy your coffee but eventually it gets enjoyable. The energy it gives you is amazing and for me it's been an appetite suppressant because I actually have the energy to get up and focus on doing things that I used to overlook. I've recommended to a lot of people. I do with it came in a bigger container. Read more | 5.0\nI am very picky about my coffee and require a high powered brew that's quick, easy, and KETO friendly. After trying many Keto snacks and shakes with mostly disappointing results, I am delighted to say Rapidfire Keto Caramel Macchiato Flavor tastes great, and reminds me of the International Coffee drinks I loved. The flavor is well balanced with the perfect amount of sweetness, no bitterness, and no heartburn. Yay!. I've been it in with my Keto and protein shakes for a quick morning eye opener, and accidentally discovered how tasty it is when I coat my dry roasted macadamia nuts with the coffee powder. You can  do that with unsweetened cocoa powder as well, but I like using this more. A super keto taste treat! Two tablespoons is the equivalent of 1 1/2 cups of coffee and I usually use one tablespoon at a time whenever I need a quick pick me up. The only con would be the canister is only half filled, and at this price they could have included a measuring scoop. A shorter container would  also make it easier to store and dispense. If not for that, I would have given this a five star review. Certainly not a deal breaker by any means, and I have reordered it to combine the contents with my first container. If you're looking for a high caffeine Keto coffee that tastes delicious and packs a punch, you can't go wrong with this one. I highly recommend it. Read more | 4.0\nSlow to dissolve, chalky taste Read more | 3.0\nI never write reviews but this product here deserves it. I bought this stuff yesterday , 10/18 at 5pm, received it today at 5am and throwing it out at 11;15am on 10/19 1) it does NOT taste like coffee, more of a watered down milk - ish unidentified something  ( can’t even figure out what it tastes like ) 2) IF you are not into JITTERS, don’t buy this stuff because it’ll give you the jitters… and I mean bad ( I pray that I stop jittering by tomorrow) 3) you can NOT return this item, so read the reviews ( first mistake as I prior bought a different item from this vendor which wasn’t bad at all, so….. trusted my instinct that all they sell is good… nope! ) If all of the above applies to you save your money and buy something else Read more | 1.0\nlove it but very expensive! Read more | 5.0\nThis is my 2nd time ordering 1st time I ordered I lost some weight I believe about 10 pounds with one container and without a diet or exercise. One container lasts me about a month and that is about 2 mugs of coffee a day. I just had a baby and within 3 weeks lost 20 pounds. And that could be due to breastfeeding and water weight but I believe it is because of my increased metabolism with the coffee. It causes me to feel thirsty however my appetite is greatly diminshed when taking it. I have another container and after that I am done. This is only a metabolism booster for me and not an everyday consumption. I lost so much weight after using this before my pregnancy and I maintained that weight loss. I recommend this as a short term solution/drink like 3-6 months or less not sure what it does to your kidneys. This is a great metabolism booster Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n3.0\n1.0\n5.0\n5.0",

    "reviews": "Vanilla Chocolate Banana Sweet Cream Coffee Tim Pool recommended this multiple times, so I had to try it. I am a coffee-loving, chalk-hating protein drink enthusiast, and let me tell you, I found my perfect match in Jocko Mölk's Sweet Cream Coffee Protein Shakes. Picture this: you've just finished a grueling workout, and you're craving something that will not only refuel your muscles but also satisfy your morning coffee fix. You reach for a Jocko Mölk, crack it open, and BAM! Your taste buds are hit with a wave of sweet, succulent coffee that's smoother than a baby's bottom. It's like a barista and a bodybuilder had a love child, and this drink is their glorious offspring. Now, I know what you're thinking. \"But wait, aren't most protein drinks chalky and gross?\" Well, my friend, that's precisely why I chose Jocko Mölk. I've had my fair share of protein drinks that taste like a mix between powdered chalk and sadness, but not this one. Oh no, Jocko Mölk has cracked the code on making a protein drink that actually tastes like a dream.

Trust me (and Tim Pool), you won't be disappointed. Read more | 5.0\nI mix this with 3 shots of espresso and lots of ice every day - wonderful Read more | 5.0\n4 stars because it wasn't a chalky tasting protein drink, and it also did not leave a weird after-taste as some do. It did not get 5 stars because the coffee flavor absolutely did NOT taste like coffee. I was super excited to find this one because it has less caffein than most other coffee protein shakes. My all-time favorite coffee protein shake by taste is the Atkins Cafe Au Lait, but unfortunately it only has 15 grams of protein. I'm now on a hunt to find a coffee protein shake that will give me the taste of the Atkins shake, but with more protein. I've tried the Premier Protein brand coffee shake that has 30 grams of protein, but it tastes like a mocha coffee instead of plain coffee. So I searched for an alternative and came across this Jocko Molk. I was sold on it as soon as I saw that it had less caffein in it, since I am really trying to restrict my caffein intake. However, I can't even say that this tastes like a mocha coffee. This one tastes straight up like chocolate milk with the barest hint of coffee flavor in it. I will not be purchasing it again, and will continue my quest to find a shake with a good coffee taste with 30 grams of protein. Read more | 4.0\nI make a smoothie with and it’s great! My son likes to read my labels and blast me for buying unhealthy stuff. He laughed at the name and was ready to dis it/me. However, he was surprised by the pretty good ingredients/nutrition label! I love it with coffee, collagen, mushroom powder, ice, and a bit of milk in the magic bullet. It gets really frothy! Not chalky like some powders. I have not tried drinking it straight from the bottle, so I have no comment on that. I’m on auto ship for this. It usually comes nicely packaged in a company box. This time the bottles were just all placed in a bag and loosely fastened. Didn’t look good. Not sure why the change. It was like someone gathered up some random bottles and sucked ‘em up! I hope it’s back to the regular way next time.

I hate to make this review but I’ve brought from Amazon, Publix’, Walmart, and vitamin shoppe wanting to try again because I swear by  these shakes and though I just got a bad batch. But no. My powers still takes good but my throat is hurting right now after trying they ones I got at Publix yesterday. Please look into it. I lived this brand but you may need to do a recall because it’s really bad and this time is worst thy my throat is burning is not normal and the taste won’t leave is scary Read more | 1.0\nI bought this protein shake since I heard good stuff about jocko.

I discovered this Starbucks instant about a month ago and I’m in love again. I find a lot of coffee is just bitter and yucky, and I won’t even buy a coffee, from a Starbucks kiosk anymore because every time I do, it just tastes burnt and leaves a nasty taste in my mouth. Based on that, I was hesitant to try this but I did, because we were having a big get together and I didn’t want to rely on the napresso for everyone. It smelled so good, as people were fixing it, that I decided to have a cup and,,,omg,,,it was so surprised. The medium roast is so nice and smooth. If you like it stronger, just add a bit more.

Then I just placed it in my cup and let it steep, then drank it as the grounds settled to the bottem. That was good. Then I got out my Black and Decker coffee grinder,that I purchased on Amazon, and made it finer then put it in the k-cup. Perfect. A little Stevia, yum. I like it as a after dinner drink instead of dessert. Keeps me from snacking later too. Read more | 5.0\nI love this product! It makes my coffee taste incredible. I add a couple of spoonfuls mixed with my ground coffee before brewing, and it tastes like heaven. Read more | 5.0\nIt's good, but honestly I like chicory root more for a coffee substitute. This brews more like tea than coffee, and you can't use regular coffee filters. At this price you'd be better off buying cacao nibs in bulk and roasting them yourself Read more | 4.0\nWe add this in roughly equal proportions with our coffee beans freshly ground in a metal filter which is highly recommended for this product. Adds great chocolate flavor notes as well as reduces overall caffeine levels. Additionally has various health benefits that are different than those provided by coffee by itself. Read more | 5.0\nBased solely on the instructions and using a french press, the product wasn't nearly as robust as I had hoped. The smell was intoxicating before I brewed it, and based on the size of bag, cost of product, and amount recommended, this bag makes 2-1/2 8 cup French press batches at a rate of about $4 a cup. I often mix cocoa with my coffee and was looking for something to replace an afternoon cup. This product left me disappointed. I recommend steeping it for double the recommended time since I would more likely equate it to chocolate tea rather than coffee. Read more | 3.0\nI used a French press with 2 Tablespoons of ground cocoa for 8 oz. of boiling water.  I brewed it for 6 minutes, stirred, and then brewed for another minute.  In other words, I followed the directions exactly but used the lower amount in the suggested range of product and the shorter amount in the suggested range of brewing.  The result was absolutely delicious.  If you like chocolate, this is a wonderful way to consume it without a lot of calories. Read more | 5.0\nLatest. The problem. This product might be more successful IF the cacao was pelletized to a uniform size and shape like coffee. Mixing smallish pieces with powder makes real brewing impossible. Once wet, cacao absorbs a lot of water (high water holding capacity). Other uses? This might work in cake and muffin batter. ///////// Original view It appears to be chopped up cacao. I tried it twice in a French press and learned I got around 5 oz of drink using 16 oz of water. The cacao absorbs way too much water to be useful or worth the trouble. Of course they tell users on the bag not to use paper filters. I found that pouring it through a typical sieve It merely clogged up the sieve. The claims on the back seem rather unsubstantiated. Okay, it has flavonoids but there's no assessment of how much flavonoid. It's zero sugar which makes sense or very low sugar. It contains theobromine. I didn't get much kick from it. It says that it's loaded with natural mood enhancers. So there's no assessment of how many enhancers for the mood you get. And the last one on the back of the bag is magnesium for bone brain and heart health. They listed ingredients say absolutely nothing about how much magnesium it has. There's a single comment about 2 mg 20 mg etc etc. maybe it is nanograms? I have no idea what I'm going to do with the rest of the bag. It might be possible to put it in my grinder and make it super super fine like Hershey's powdered chocolate and see where that takes me. The impression I get from the description on the bag and the description on Amazon is that this was going to act something like coffee grounds. This is nowhere near or even close to being coffee grounds.  You get a small amount to actually drink and a larger portion of it that is made up of soggy cacao fines. Read more | 1.0\nThis product has helped me keep my sugar cravings to a minimal, helping me with my weight loss journey.  I use a French press and follow the directions and have a mug almost every night.  I add some sugar free creamer and it is incredible. It also doesn’t impact my glucose at all.

    "reviews": "We love this product! First let me say that comparing it to other brands before we purchased it we found that it has more mushroom blends in it & has a lot more herbal in it. We have found we like to drink it with heated milk & mct coconut oil (just 1 teaspoon) & it gives it a creamier taste & works better for me then drinking it with water. My husband & I both are using it & have seen results within a week. This has helped in several areas of our life. Gut health is a big one plus energy & focus there is a big difference. We have also cut out processed sugars in our lives so all around we are seeing a big difference. Thanks Monkey for coming out with this product! We are on the reorder list for sure! Read more | 5.0\nThis mushroom coffee blend seems like a great option for those looking to cut down on caffeine without sacrificing energy and focus. With functional ingredients like Lion’s Mane for memory, Turkey Tail for immunity, and Turmeric for inflammation, it promises a health boost with every cup. At just 30 calories per serving, it’s light but packed with nutrients. If you enjoy earthy flavors and want a wellness twist to your morning brew, this could be a solid choice. Plus, the brewing process is simple and convenient. Worth a try if you’re exploring coffee alternatives! Read more | 5.0\nI was a bit shocked when I first tasted Monkey Brew. I have used other mushroom coffees in the past and they all had the \"coffee\" taste to them. Monkey Brew has more of a hot chocolate feel to it. A pleasant surprise. I like the coffee taste but this is great to put in my protein shakes. It mixes well with my protein and doesn't separate when mixed the night before, a little shake and off we go. I am only 4-5 shakes into the bag but so far so good. Read more | 5.0\nAdmittedly we got caught up in main stream advertisements for another popular brand of mushroom coffee. That brand was ok, but is priced pretty high so we thought we'd give this one a try and we're pleasantly suprised at how much better Monkey Brew tastes! At a price point that's more palatable,  the flavor is also more palatable. Read more | 4.0\nSo I've been having trouble focusing for the last two years, and I heard about Monkey Brew. I ordered it and now have been taking every morning for two weeks. Yes, I can tell a difference in my focusing, but especially in my energy. I don't get as tired as I used to. I'm sold, I will continue to take it every day!! Read more | 5.0\nI gave Monkey Brew - Organic Mushroom Coffee Alternative a try because I was looking for something to help with energy, focus, calmness, and gut health due to my traumatic brain injury (TBI). Unfortunately, I was disappointed. The biggest issue for me was the taste—it literally tastes like dirt. I had higher expectations based on the positive reviews, but when I tried it, the flavor made it difficult to drink. I’m still working through my first bag, but I have to force myself to drink it, and that’s a major downside. As for the claimed benefits like promoting calmness, focus, energy, and gut health, I haven’t really noticed any significant changes. I purchased it because I have digestion issues from the injury and hoped it could help, but so far, I haven’t experienced the results I was hoping for. I also take a probiotic, but I was looking for an additional boost, which this product hasn’t provided yet. I’m not giving up completely, but for now, I would say that unless you’re okay with the taste, it might not be worth it. I’ll update if I see any improvements down the road. Rating: ⭐⭐⭐ (3/5) – Tastes Bad and No Noticeable Effects Yet Read more | 3.0\nMonkey Brew mushrooms coffee has the perfect flavor, it is smooth and rich.

    "reviews": "Vermont Maple Southern Pecan Smooth Blend Morning Roast Hazelnut French Vanilla French Roast Donut Shop Coffee Lovers Cinnamon Chocolate Hazelnut Creme Caramel Butter Toffee Blueberry Vanilla Assorted Variety Pack Update 1/23: Wow even years later the company delivers. I just bought a new coffee machine Ninja Dual Pro and there's a way to make a stronger brew with k-pods - so I tried Rich Brew setting with these in 6 oz, 8 oz and extra-strong Specialty Brew on 4 oz. First of all not all k-cups will have a compatible cup with my Ninja (those with hard plastic won't pierce at all). But these babies pierce wonderfully, you will hear a loud pop! This morning alone I had 3 cups of coffee, and really liked the flavors but now I guess my taste buds changed because I couldn't really discern the flavors all that much. They all sounds super exciting like \"chocolate hazelnut\"(my most favorite flavor in the world), but I couldn't really taste it. So, finally I decided to have one cup with no sweetener just so I can gauge the bitterness, and honestly even though it can't compete w French Press or Espresso, it's still nice and not overly acidic or bitter. A hint of bitterness but very smooth. The 8 oz setting is good enough, and hits the perfect spot -  with 6 oz and 4 oz you immediately in bitter territory and I have to pour a ton of half-n-half which is more carbs than I want. Overall it's STILL an amazing coffee! Even though I didn't get lucky this time to get awesome flavors like raspberry or cherry chocolate, (I ordered a smaller batch) and got the dreaded cinnamon and toffee, I am super happy and had finished them all - they are not as strong anymore, not too acidic or bitter, and I wouldn't hesitate to buy again. I had a 40 pack but wish I gotten the 100 pack, the value is incredible and its totally worth it. They bring SO MUCH delight to my mornings!!! 5 years ago: It’s damn good coffee!!! I received around 120 pods when was supposed to be 100, the flavors are amazing although I haven’t even tried them all. Pod quality is superb 5 stars, very sturdy and never broke. My favorite and strongest flavor is Hazelnut, it’s very caramel like , then Caramel less pronounced, then Vanilla is barely there. Also a blueberry was a pleasant surprise and I liked it. Maple and Pecan I can’t ever really tell the flavor as it’s so faint. Also to compare I bought a Green Mountain caramel vanilla pod, and to me this coffee is stronger, although the flavor only compares to Hazelnut in strength. I haven’t tried Cinnamon yet. Overall INCREDIBLE value for the money and strong coffee that’s awesome but not overpowering in terms of flavor. My least favorite flavor was  Toffee, it’s the most artificial yucky flavor that I just couldn’t stand and it’s a strong one like hazelnut. But overall LOVE the coffee, and it’s better than Green mountain so I absolutely recommend it!!!! What an amazing find !!! Read more | 5.0\nLook, I am not and never have been a big coffee person. Three reasons: I don't really need the energy, I really don't like the taste of coffee and coffee is usually unreasonably expensive to drink to have daily basis. That has changed the equation for me. I still don't need the energy but these pods taste fantastic with 1.25 cups of water and a little almond milk to top it off. Not a single flavor gives me the same scowl I have always gotten from drinking coffee. I would still never be drinking coffee if not for these coffee pods. I got a $35 machine and with this variety pack I am set for easily 4-5 months. If you drink a cup every single morning, it comes out to less than 0.35 cents a day which is a value you can't get almost anywhere else. I lack the expertise to comment on the specific qualities of this coffee versus other brands but I am genuinely impressed by the quality, consistency and value of this product. 5/5 Would buy again, will buy again. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the 40 count sampler that included various flavors. I had 4 of a raspberry flavor that I don't see on the photo or listing so I think the actual flavors you receive will vary. Other listings also list random flavors not mentioned (like choco cherry) so don't count on receiving what you see listed, which may be good or maybe not. I didn't care for the raspberry flavor so getting 10% of my order for a flavor not listed wasn't great. (There's a hilarious review on here for the raspberry flavor and beavers and it's origins that I fully agree with!).  I don't usually like fruit flavors which is why i ordered this sampler which was listed as heavy on the pecan and toffee flavors. For many years I've bought and used flavored creamers in plain coffee. I'm learning that many of the creamers have chemical ingredients so I'm trying to wean myself off their use. I thought I'd try some flavored coffees to drink black which is why I bought these. Crave doesn't list the ingredients for the flavoring on the package. Overall they are a mixed box (literally as they just come loose in an amazon box). Some flavors are better than others, of course. I did not find them to be strong in coffee flavor and not strong in specialty flavor. I would say they are medium at best. It is hard to find strong coffees in k-cups and so I don't hold it against these but these are definitely not going to turbo boost your day with strength if you like over 8 oz of brew.  I'm about halfway through the sampler and the only flavor I have removed to give away is the raspberry. The cups are super cute in design. They are bright and all show a woman with a cup of coffee and a cartoon smile on the cup. They are different colors according to flavor. I have not had any problem with them fitting into my coffee maker's  Kcup holder.  My local stores are selling other brand coffee Kcups at close to 80 cents a piece or more. This Crave sample was half that price and I appreciate the savings. It's even less if you subscribe and save. Who is this ideal for? I'd say it's ideal for an Airbnb, VRBO, STR or bed and breakfast situation. The price is right. It's an assortment of flavors. And they will look super cute in your Kcup holder or display. And if guests take them home unused it won't break the bank.  It is also a good purchase for someone who wants to try the various flavors that are available by themselves. Also pretty good for keeping on hand a mixed sampler for company. The price was great. The flavors were YMMV (your mileage may vary). You will probably find a couple you like and a couple you don't, but that's the whole point of a sampler.  The listing says they are Kosher and that they have 0 calories and 0 sweeteners although there's nothing in the box that lists ingredients. It says Arabica beans are used.  In the Q&A the manufacturer (Two Rivers Coffee) says there is 120mg of caffeine per 8 oz cup. They also say  in Q&A that the ingredients are \"100% Arabica coffee beans and artificial flavoring\" They also say \"Artificial flavors are considered a trade secret. They fall under the category of GRAS- Generally recognized as safe for Human consumption by the FDA.\" so  take that as you will... Overall I would say these are GOOD. Some are very good, some are meh. They are not my holy grail but I will keep them in stock in our vacation place that we airbnb out.

Over the years, illy has perfected this process to obtain a coffee with a rich aromatic profile, balanced flavor and a one-of-a-kind aroma.  To make our coffee, we select only the finest Arabica coffee plants, grown sustainably by our farmers in over 30 countries around the world. We cultivate long-lasting relationships with them based on shared values and personal growth. Because it is only by working together that we can achieve exceptional results.  We select only the 1% of the finest Arabica coffee beans, thanks to many years of collaboration with growers who place maximum importance on quality and sustainability. Researching and experimenting with raw materials is a journey that never ends. After processing, the beans undergo a meticulous selection to ensure zero defects: even a single imperfect Arabica coffee bean can compromise the aroma of our blend. We preserve and enhance the aromas through our patented pressurized cans. Patented in 1934 by illy, pressurization is a preservation system in which the air in the tin is replaced by an inert gas at a pressure greater than that of the atmosphere. In this way, not only is the freshness of our coffee maintained, but its aroma is also enhanced.

The taste is outstanding and the medium roasted whole beans are not real oily and the taste is phenomenal. Excellent choice. Read more | 5.0\nI generally prefer a dark roast for my \"regular\" coffee, but a medium roast is usually recommended for Turkish coffee.  I didn't much like the pre-ground Turkish coffees I'd found, and since I have a hand grinder that will do the ultra-fine grind you need for Turkish, I decided to try an 8 oz package of the Illy. It works very well for that purpose, and I probably will not buy the pre-ground Turkish coffees again; this tastes much better.  It's a bit expensive per ounce, but since I'll only be using a couple of teaspoons at a time, the 8 oz pack should last for a while. I also tried making my regular morning coffee with this, grinding it a little less fine and using a Moka Pot, adding extra water afterward for an \"Americano\".  It was fine that way too, better than other medium roasts I've had, but I think I'll stick with dark roasts for everything except Turkish coffee.

This is a 4-pack of 11-ounce iced coffee protein shakes. They offer 15mg of protein per bottle. For me, that's enough to increase my intake but not so much that it messes with my gut. I definitely have an issue at times with high-protein products, but these are tasty, effective, and also include a nice little boost. These are low sugar, low carb, gluten free, and low glycemic. They do have 3g of dietary fiber. They're also keto friendly. I'm in the middle of trying to do some wound healing and I'm noticing that increasing my protein has really helped. I've already ordered these a couple times and will continue to do so. They give me a perfect combination of healthy drink that also tastes great.

While there are some great things to eat that are low carb, the food you can eat are hard to travel with or eat/drink on the go. This is very easy to grab and go in the morning. Being coffee flavored, it tastes like a caramel macchiato available at popular coffee shops. If at work or at home, I drink it from a glass filled with ice especially in the summer. It doesn't need to be refrigerated making it easy to store at home or work. I keep a 4 pack in the refrigerator at home to grab and go. The prices are great on Amazon compared to grocery stores. Only when the grocery stores sell this product at ~50% is the price comparable. I've shared this with others and those used to diet foods love it. If you are on a low carbohydrate diet, try at least a 4 pack and you may be so happy you did. It comes in other flavors but this one is my absolute favorite.

The caramel coffee/latte-ish flavor is present but not overpowering. I am personally not overly sensitive to caffeine, but I CAN tell it provides a little extra boost which is so great for having one of these in the morning when you might not yet be hungry - protein the morning helping your bloodsugar, feeling fuller, and giving some energy - and adding that little boost of caffeine is just fabulous.

    "reviews": "48 Ounce (Pack of 1) 5 Pound (Pack of 1) 1.5 Pound (Pack of 1) 10 Ounce (Pack of 1) In 27 years I have received thousands of Amazon orders. I have reviewed a mere fraction of the items. This cocoa is worthy of my time.  I put in a small Bodun French press, because I wanted one cup to try. I added a tabsp of heavy whipping cream and frothed it with a handheld mini frother. This is a fantastic cup of happiness to start my day. It is like a homemade cup of cocoa I might make for an honored guest after a day on the ski slopes! I didn't even add sugar. It is that good! I am going to reinvent the Ned Flanders Cocoa Recipe so it's low calorie and even happier. (Serves 1) Ingredients: 1 cup whole milk (or your preferred milk) 2 tbsp unsweetened cocoa powder 1-2 tbsp sugar (adjust to taste) 1/4 tsp vanilla extract Pinch of salt Whipped cream (optional) Chocolate shavings or sprinkles (optional) Marshmallows (because Flanders would!) Instructions:  Heat the Milk: In a small saucepan over medium heat, warm the milk until it's steaming but not boiling. Mix Cocoa and Sugar: In a separate bowl, whisk together the cocoa powder, sugar, and salt. Combine: Add a couple of tablespoons of the hot milk to the cocoa mixture and stir until smooth, forming a paste. Add to Milk: Pour the cocoa paste back into the saucepan, stirring continuously. Flavor: Add the vanilla extract and continue stirring until everything is well combined and heated through. Serve: Pour into your favorite mug, top with whipped cream, marshmallows, and maybe a sprinkle of chocolate. Bonus Ned Flanders Touch: Serve it with a cheerful smile and perhaps a “Hi-diddly-ho!” Read more | 5.0\nIf you are looking for a coffee substitute, buy this. If you are looking for a hot chocolate drink, look elsewhere. From my understanding, this is made with the shells or outer part of the cocoa bean. They are roasted and then you brew it like coffee. Like coffee, it is bitter, not sweet, and will have the same viscosity of coffee, not cocoa. You will notice a very small about of fat in the brewed drink, my guess is from residual cocoa butter--we are talking trace amount. I blended mine in a coffee grinder, brewed in a french press, mixed after it steeped for 6-8 minutes with a frother,  strained at 10 minutes, and then added my creamer and sweetener. To me, it tasted much like coffee with a hint/aftertaste of chocolate. Also, smells really good when it is steeping. Read more | 5.0\nYou have to use a lot to get a good flavor. I used a drip coffee maker using 24 ounces of water with at least 2/3 cup of the cacao. So it is very expensive but a nice coffee substitute. Read more | 4.0\nSo, I really do like it. However, it is not coffee, not even close, it is very different. With that being said, I really like it, but I highly recommend not following their directions! I add 50% more cacao powder and let it soak longer. For a French press let it soak and maybe stir occasionally. I like to use my Final Press by I adding boiling water to my cup then dip the Final Press into the water. I gently tap it to get all the air bubbles out for a little bit. Then I cover it for 5 minutes. Then I press the handle a few times to get the cacao breathing. I let it set for 5-10 more minutes and repeat. I do this until the cacao nibs feel slightly spongy. Then I work the Final Press handle a number of times until the mixture look rich and luxurious. This takes about at least 15 minutes. I just let it soak. I have accidentally let it soak 30 minutes and one time for an hour. This is when it was at its best. Like I said it’s not coffee, but it is very very good if you don’t mind taking the time to enjoy the process :) P.S. I hope you try this and enjoy not only the cacao, but the process as well. Read more | 5.0\nDisappointed today that my bag of Crio Bro arrived busted and spilling cacao. I can't tell whether it was improperly sealed at the source, or whether it broke open during shipping. There wasn't a lot spilled, but  and this stuff isn't cheap. I don't believe returns are permitted, so I'm definitely keeping what's left in the bag for consumption. We have been drinking Crio Bro in my household almost daily over the past couple of years, and this is of course a disappointment. Read more | 3.0\nI love it! Tastes delicious! Read more | 5.0\nIt CAN NOT be brewed just like coffee. The description was a lie.  You must have a special filter and even then, it comes out literally clear. I can drink hot water for free.  Enormous waste of $20 and can't be returned. Read more | 1.0\nFirst off, this stuff smells amazing.  It is cacao, after all.  So, as soon as you open the bag, boom!  Chocolate scent in your face! It is more work to brew, than coffee.  For my coffee, I just put it and the water in my french press, then stick it in the fridge to cold brew, overnight.  From what I have read, some people have cold brewed the cacao, but they had to use more of it.  Considering how crazy expensive it already is, I'm not trying to do that.  So, I hot brew the cacao, then make a mixture of approximately 40% coffee and 60% cacao.  This gives the best of both worlds (coffee and chocolate).  You get your caffeine boost (but a lower amount) from the coffee, and the delicious flavor and aroma from the cacao.  Plus, doing this stretches my cacao further, effectively making it cost less per cup, while still being amazing.

    "description": "Peet's Major Dickason's Blend Dark Roast Coffee is the roast that put Peet's Coffee on the map. A loyal customer of our original Berkeley store, retired army sergeant Key Dickason, brought the idea for our most beloved blend to Mr. Peet in 1969. Intrigued, our founder worked with the local gourmand and coffee aficionado to refine it. They sampled countless combinations before arriving at what is now our all-time bestseller. The result was so good, Alfred Peet decided naming it after his friend wasn't enough. Dickason's rich, complex blend also deserved a promotion from sergeant to major. Major Dickason's combines the best origin coffees from the world's premier growing regions, each imparting its distinctive regional characteristics while still effortlessly rounding into a smooth, balanced cup. Over the years, it has become the coffee that epitomizes Peet's: flavorful, deeply roasted, and unsurpassingly satisfying. But for us, \"Major D\" is just like a relationship with an old friend.

    "reviews": "Hundred Mile Homestead Blend French Roast Founder's Blend Hair Bender I’ve tried many medium roast coffees, but this one stands out as my absolute favorite. The balance of flavor is perfect—smooth and rich with just the right amount of depth. It has a warm, toasty aroma that fills the room as it brews, and each sip delivers a beautifully rounded taste.  What I love most is how it’s bold enough to be satisfying yet never too bitter or overpowering. Whether enjoyed black or with a splash of milk, it consistently delivers a great cup. If you're looking for a well-rounded, flavorful medium roast, I highly recommend giving this one a try! Read more | 5.0\nDelicious smooth coffee! Switched to Stumptown from Folgers after reading about the coffee bean industry and all the nasties they use when growing the beans and the difference is so real. I love these coffee beans. So smooth and there’s none of that bitter bite you taste when you make a strong cup of brew. I use a percolator without an additional filter besides the weak strainer that percolators come with. Theres no paper filter needed. Thanks Stumptown for your amazing coffee!  May God bless your business and pursuit of clean coffee. Read more | 5.0\nGood quality beans. Roast is a bit light for me. Nice fruity taste no bitterness. I think this would make a great iced coffee. A little pricey IMO Read more | 4.0\nEDIIT—I tired the Holler blend and much prefer the Mountain Blend! I hVe it on subscribe and save and will be upping the delivery timeline! It’s great? First, I wish Stumptown would  train other companies on how to package (specifically vacuum-seal) coffee beans! I think I’ve ordered a total of at least ten different brands from Amazon over the years and this is the first that’s been packaged well and sealed tightly to keep them fresh! I ordered the Homestead blend. It’s a good stout medium blend; maybe slightly bitter but that’s easy to counter if it’s an issue for you. The reviews I read had me a little concerned at firstly but I’m glad I took the chance on this brand, One review mentioned they can’t taste the flavor profile and while that’s true for the Homestead too, in my experience you don’t always have to in order for it to be good coffee. I play around with my own spice blends in coffee and don’t always taste the exact spice, but it  still flavors it differently. I think that’s what this  (at least the Homestead blend) is doing. Homestead is a milk chocolate and candy blend, which honestly I don’t think I’d like to taste in my coffee, but the coffee just tastes well-rounded and bold for a medium blend. I also wonder if the chocolate may be where that slight bitter taste I get comes from. Several reviews also mentioned the brew and best used-by dates. Mine was brewed in late June, purchased in August, and best used by October.  I purchase whole bean coffee for its freshness and it loses freshness quickly, so to me that’s a good time frame. I usually will go through a bag this size is maybe 2-3 weeks so if I received it as some did within a couple weeks of best used-by date, it would be an issue but I would hope returns would be accepted based on late dates. I’ll definitely be taking a chance and ordering this product again! (And would update review if the use-by date were an issue because I’m a firm believer in holding companies accountable for intentional or unintentional issues in business practices.) Stumptown will be my go-to coffee bean on Amazon as long as they’ve fixed their use-by date issue! Read more | 5.0\nThe Negative Reviews Were On Point- the beans were not fresh, hardly any notable coffee flavors, it does take more beans to make a cup (I thought it was just me), and it is overpriced considering the end product. I guess I should have read the reviews before buying it. Noticed the beans on the left are more glossy (meaning the oils haven't been stripped) than the ones on the right (Stumptown, which I received a little more than a week ago and only opened a couple of days ago). My experience: - I first tried it with my espresso machine. The grind was dry and powdery. The crema was lacking and it looked a little watery. The taste was acidic, not nutty or roasted. The taste was akin to stale beans or decaf, slight sour taste. The notes were definitely not of vanilla or cocoa powder (as the label advertised). - I admit I'm no barista, so I gave it another go. This time with a pour over, which IMHO I'm better at. As another reviewer noted, it did take a little more beans to make a comparable cup. But the end results were still the same, still the same acidic/sour taste of stale beans, no notes of vanilla or cocoa powder. I threw away the package so I don't know when the roasted and good by dates were. FWIW, I didn't like their bottled cold brews (same acidic/sour taste) and was willing to try them out bc heck we're talking whole roasted organic beans and at a relatively attractive price.. But no. I'll stick with my Lavazza (the beans on the left in pic). Read more | 1.0\nI got a bag of Homestead Blend a few months ago from the Stumptown cafe during a visit to Portland. I typically get Dunkin or Tim Hortons beans from Amazon - both have a pretty good flavor and are inexpensive. I usually do pourover but sometimes use an Aeropress. The Homestead Blend bag from Portland had a nice strong body with no hint of over-roastedness. The flavor was sweet, light, nuanced, and very enjoyable. It instantly became one of my new favorites. I was apprehensive about ordering a bag from Amazon because I've seen reviewers mentioning that they were expired and/or tasted off. Stumptown is typically about $16 at my local grocery store, compared to about $6 for Hortons on Amazon, so kind of a step up in cost. I saw that Homestead Blend was on sale on Amazon so I decided to try it. I received my bag on October 2. It was roasted on July 30 and the expiration is given as November 27, so indeed it is not fresh from the roaster. But as far as I can tell, it tastes as good as the bag from Portland. And it'll be used up long before the expiration. So this order was a win for me. I'll definitely try another one. Read more | 5.0\n1.0\n5.0\n5.0\n1.0",

Love it like a poet loves a typewriter, like a vinyl collector loves the warm crackle of a first press. But my body? Not so much. Turns out my nervous system doesn’t appreciate being treated like a hummingbird on a double-shot espresso bender. Enter Dandy Blend, the magical potion that made me rethink everything I thought I knew about caffeine, balance, and the pure joy of a warm mug between my hands. First off, let’s talk flavor—because that’s what I was skeptical about. I expected something that tasted like regret and disappointment, but instead, Dandy Blend delivers this rich, smooth, roasted goodness that could easily pass for a nutty, mellow coffee (especially with a splash of oat milk, because, Portland). There’s no bitterness, no acidity, no post-caffeine crash that makes you question your life choices. Just pure, velvety bliss. And versatility? This stuff dissolves instantly like some kind of wizardry. Hot or cold, it blends into perfection. You want a light, tea-like experience? Just use a little. You want a robust, espresso-adjacent drink? Pile it on. Feeling fancy? Froth it up with some cinnamon and maple syrup, and boom—you’ve basically got a forest-witch-approved latte. I’ll admit, I still go halfsies sometimes—mixing it with coffee when I want the flavor but need to trick my body into thinking I’m being responsible. And you know what? It works. It blends so seamlessly that even my coffee-snob friends didn’t notice when I swapped half their beans for roasted dandelion root. (Sorry, Jeremy. You were decaf for a week. You seemed happier.) Plus, it’s good for you in that mystical, ancient-herbalist kind of way. Dandelion root and chicory have been healing people since before oat milk was cool, and somehow, they managed to pack trace minerals and gut-loving goodness into a drink that tastes like a hug. The only downside? If you leave the bag open, it clumps up faster than a drum circle at a folk festival. But hey, that’s on me. A small price to pay for liberation from caffeine tyranny. Final verdict: If you’re looking for a warm, roasted, jitter-free alternative that lets you live your best Pacific Northwest, self-sustaining, slightly-smug-but-in-a-good-way life—Dandy Blend is the way to go. Your adrenals will thank you. Your stomach will thank you. And honestly, your barista might resent you for spending less money at their shop, but that’s okay. They’ll survive.

It does not come cold so I don’t see how it’s not and yes for those who say that because I’m on EBT does not mean that I don’t work and does not mean that I don’t pay taxes because in fact, I actually had to pay taxes which is fine. I’ll work my butt off for both of my kids and sometimes I just like to have a treat. I don’t get a whole lot of food stamps, but I’d like to have something. Read more | 5.0\nI discovered Dandy Blend when i was forced (for health reasons) to go on a diet that excluded ALL caffeine - not even decaff tea was allowed. But on the slip that the specialist gave me detailing my diet, next to \"no caffeine\" it said \"Dandy Blend ok\". I thought \"what's dandy blend?\" I love my decaff Nespresso pods and so the thought of not being able to have my creamy hot morning drink, I went home and looked up Dandy Blend online to find it on Amazon. I actually like it just as much as coffee and maybe a little better.  It tastes delicious cold or hot. Its easy to mix and comes in the same form as instant coffee so it immediately blends and dissolves with any liquid.  I've had it sweet or without any sweetener. I have it with almond milk or black and its seriously delicious any which way you spin it.  However, word to those of you who are looking for something that tastes exactly like coffee but has no caffeine - if you blind tested Dandy and coffee, you could easily tell which is which. But its delicious and tastes similar enough that after only a week or so, I couldn't remember how coffee tasted different. It reminds me of properly brewed cold coffee where it lacks any acidity taste but is still very rich and smooth. So the taste was more than enough for me to drink it, but then i stumbled upon the health benefits of dandelion and i'm a Dandy Blend lifer now! 1. Digestion: Dandelion root is a mild laxative and also balances the good bacteria found in your intestines. It also helps your stomach and liver release stomach acid and bile which keeps your digestion moving properly. 2. Kidney support: Dandelion is a diuretic which assists the kidneys in flushing out waste, salt and excess water. This can be especially helpful for women who have trouble with bloating during PMS. Instead of leaving you dehydrated from water loss, dandelion will replenish your potassium stores which is an important electrolyte. 3. Liver support: As mentioned above, Dandelion root helps the liver release bile which is an important function of this organ. This promotes removal of toxins and replenishment of electrolytes. 4. Antioxidants: It is known that coffee can help remove free radicals but it is also known that dandelion root does this better! Dandelion root is packed full of antioxidants which slows the aging process (while coffee actually accelerates aging). 5. Cancer fighting: Dandelion has been shown to fight cancer cells and this claim has been backed up with A LOT of research. Every part of this plant is packed with antioxidants and phytonutrients that have been proven to slow the growth and even prevent formation of cancer cells. 6. Diabetes: This is another benefit of coffee which is listed above, so why not switch over to Dandy blend to have the same benefits PLUS many more! Dandelion helps regulate blood sugar and insulin which is something that coffee actually destroys. 7, Blood pressure: Dandelion’s diuretic effects leads to more frequent urination which in turn will lower blood pressure. Fiber and Potassium found in Dandelion will also regulate blood pressure. 8. Inflammation: While most people are aware of the inflammation they can experience in physical injuries, more education is starting to reach people about the issues that internal inflammation can cause. Inflammation is the culprit in many diseases and illnesses today. Dandelion will reduce inflammation through it’s essential fatty acids, antioxidants, and phytonutrients. This reduction of inflammation helps internally as well as externally from sport injuries. 9. Immune System: If what I mentioned above wasn’t enough, dandelion boosts immune function! It destroys any bugs entering your system so can be especially helpful during the winter months. The only downside of Dandy Blend is that it is VERY susceptible to moisture and will start to dissolve so if any drops get into your Dandy container, you'll wind up with sticky clumps of moist dandy paste.  However, we keep our in a simple vacuum container that we used to keep our coffee in for freshness and we have had no problems at all. The product bag also has a ziplock top so you could also just keep it in the product bag if you didn't want to invest in an airtight container. And to answer your question, no, i was NOT paid to post this review or given a free bag of  Dandy Blend. But, if the vendor ever wanted to send me a free bag of Dandy, I would certainly not complain. :) Read more | 5.0\nWhat others are saying is true, this tastes great.  Pricey but worth it if you love coffee but have to give up the acidity.  Super smooth without that instant coffee wang even though this is instant as well.  Made weak it leans more towards tea but still super tasty.  I couldn’t be more impressed. Read more | 5.0\nThis stuff is delicious.  Coffee now seems boring in comparison, so I was able to quit my pot-a-day habit immediately.  Shipping was terrible, though.  Took forever to come and the container was torn and emptied into the shipping envelope before I opened it, so that was a bust.  Try to get it at a local grocery or health food store to avoid the hassle. Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\nDandyBlend ist mein Favorit bei den Instant Kaffeealternativen. Leider steigt der Preis immer mehr... Geschmacklich aber definitiv zu empfehlen, schön geröstet und vollmundig, nicht so sauer wie Kaffee. Löst sich in warmem und kaltem Wasser sehr gut auf. Ich lasse das aufgekochte Wasser immer etwas abkühlen, da ich bei sprudelnd kochendem das Gefühl habe, es verbrennt den Geschmack etwas. Ohne Milch riecht es etwas \"gemüsig\". | 5.0",

This medium-roasted marvel combines the rich decadence of dark chocolate with the nutty allure of hazelnut, creating a flavor profile that’s both sinfully delicious and surprisingly smooth. It’s like having dessert for breakfast, but without the guilt—or the judgmental stares. Brew up a cup of this full-bodied elixir, and you’ll find yourself poised in the perfect purgatory between indulgence and invigoration. The aroma alone is enough to make you swoon, with notes of fudge and toasted hazelnut wafting through the air like a siren’s call to your taste buds. And the taste? Let’s just say it’s so good, even your taste buds will high-five each other. But don’t let the decadent flavor fool you—this coffee packs the everlasting strength you need to tackle your day. Whether you’re facing a mountain of emails, a toddler on a sugar rush, or just the existential dread of Monday mornings, Death Wish has got your back. Plus, it’s made with Fair Trade arabica and robusta beans, so you can feel good about every sip. So go ahead, indulge in a cup (or three). After all, life’s too short for boring coffee. Read more | 5.0\nLet me start with I am a black coffee drinker that’s not a brag just a fact I don’t do cream or sugar or any other additional items.  I have been drinking coffee for 45 years starting with sips of my grandparents Sanka and my old mans Folgers.  I hoarded instant packets from MREs in the Marine Corps and even had gas stations cups from almost every state in the continental US.  Was on a mad search in Europe for what they called an Americano in between espressos and every other drink to be had. Very few cups of coffee impressed me, I also never turn down a cup no matter the source.  This was remarkable, the scent obvious but not obnoxious reminiscent of a Jiffy Blueberry muffin mix but less sweet.  I just cold brewed a gallon of basic arabica for the week I add two Tblsp of Vanilla and a 1/2 tsp of salt to the batch to cut acidity even more and add a richer fragrance.  No one can taste the vanilla but lots of friends think it’s something extra expensive (I use Kirkland Arabica cheap beans.), this is my go to morning and all day drink.  This Blueberry Coffee makes me question my every method and appreciate the way they managed to make a rich strong black coffee with a subtle finish or blueberry muffin aftertaste.  It literally tastes like I washed a bite of muffin down with an amazing cup of coffee.  As I had just finished a batch of home brew, I just made a 16oz pour over to sample the Death Wish and was blown away by the aroma at first and then how the flavor is so much more subtle and full of true coffee toasty smokey woodsy tones.  I cannot recommend this enough to anyone that appreciates a strong cup of coffee but also isn’t averse to a treat of subtle dessert like flavor. This has me thinking I’ll chug my gallon (super concentrated cold brew)deal with the week of productivity as I crush life in general and start my next batch with this Blueberry Brew. This would be the best gift for a coffee lover and completely different from any of the 1000s of variety I have seen elsewhere, and a certain winner in your cabinet to start your day or extend it and reward yourself. This is one of the top 3 cups of coffee I have ever had in almost 50 years! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\nEn general es un buen café. de sabor firme pero sin ser tosco; contrario a lo que algunas personas podrían esperar, atendiendo al slogan de la misma marca: \"El café mas fuerte del mundo\". Al menos no respecto al sabor o acidez. Se podría decir que es algo apenas sobre el promedio. Si se sigue al pie de la letra la cantidad de café por mililitros de agua que recomienda la marca, para la elaboración de la mezcla, en definitiva se consigue un café muy cargado, lo cual si entregaría un brebaje muy fuerte. Honestamente resulta oneroso (aun en oferta) como para saciar la curiosidad por el producto. En resumen: tiene buen sabor, aroma rico, pero nada del otro mundo. | 4.0\n1.0\n5.0\n2.0",

I usually get freeze dried Maxim coffee but it's taking awhile to get here. Maxim isn't perfect but it's pretty good. I don't have the will to make pourover coffee anymore and Maxim is good enough. I use quite a bit per ounce of liquid because I make a fake mocha with it and I want the coffee flavor to predominate over the chocolate sauce.  This coffee has an acrid/bitter flavor to it. It's not for me. I think I can reduce the acrid flavor by using less coffee but that will also reduce the rest of the flavor which isn't what I want. This coffee costs more per ounce than Maxim as well. I like this jar though. I use a pop top glass jar for my instant coffee but it's not big enough to fit the whole bag of Maxim in it.

Finding your “go to” foods and drinks makes it so much easier and one of my go to drink is this Atkins Strawberry Shake. It’s so smooth and tastes naturally sweet, not too sweet and not at all of the chemically aftertaste you find on many other keto drinks. Not sure if these are meant to be meal replacements but I do have one for a lunch replacement during work and it gets me through the day. I also grab one as a snack or when craving something sweet. I always keep these on hand when I’m on my keto diet and they work great for me. Lost tons of weight and do not spike my blood sugar levels.

No weird sweetness, no weird aftertaste.  Just smooth delicious chocolate. I'm doing Keto but I still like having something sweet and this fits the bill.  It's very filling and very tasty. Verdict: Keto Compatibility:  these shakes are low in net carbs and can fit a keto diet.

Plus, the smooth and creamy texture makes it feel like a treat, whether I'm enjoying it as a post-workout refuel or a mid-afternoon pick-me-up. But what truly sets this protein shake apart is its nutritional benefits. With 15 grams of protein, 4 grams of net carbs, and just 2 grams of sugar per serving, it's the perfect way to fuel my body and keep hunger at bay without any unnecessary added sugars or carbs.

Another standout feature is its convenience. Whether I'm on the go or simply don't have time to prepare a meal, this shake is the perfect solution. It's ready to drink straight from the bottle, making it ideal for busy mornings, long commutes, or anytime I need a quick and convenient source of protein.

The best part is flavor wise, I would honestly prefer the tast of this over regular chocolate milk, which it tastes like, but darker chocolate. It's honestly hard to stop yourself from drinking multiple, once you've had one. I usually Fast, so ive found this is a good way to come out of a long fasting time span without eating any solids. Or to drink this prior to fasting to get some good nutrition to last the length of the fast.

    "reviews": "Breakfast Blend French Roast Premium Roast My husband and I got a Keurig and have since tried a multitude of coffee flavors and brands. McCafe Premium Roast stands out among the rest as our absolute favorite due to it's flavor and price. It's a great bold (but not bitter) regular roast that can even be enjoyed black. The price is also phenomenally cheaper than at my local grocery store, and, for me, this large of a pack cannot be found anywhere but on Amazon. Read more | 5.0\nsmooth taste mild strength not bitter or acidic. an easy every day coffee. Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love the taste of McDonalds coffee and this was my first time buying it and now have been purchasing it regularly for the past 5 months. Very fair price for the number of pods in the box but also comes in several count pods and all fair priced.  I enjoy my coffee in the morning with this perfect strength of a slightly bold flavor but not an acid taste so it's smooth on your stomach. The caffeine content in this particular box is perfect so I'm not flooded with to much caffeine that leaves you speeding. This is a great tasting smooth coffee flavor🙃 Read more | 5.0\nI have McCafe K-cups on auto-ship and have received it 84 times. I LOVE this coffee - it is not bitter and Is very smooth! Starting the day with a perfect cup of coffee is so important to me and this arrangement is perfect. If you are tired of high priced exotic coffee drinks, this gives great flavor, amazing aroma and reasonable pricing. Read more | 5.0\nMcCafe Premium Roast K-Cups offer a consistent and reliable coffee experience. The medium roast provides a well-balanced flavor with a smooth finish. Consistent Flavor: Each cup delivers a consistent and predictable flavor profile. Convenient: K-Cups offer a quick and easy brewing method. Widely Available: Easily found at most grocery stores and convenience stores. Affordable: Generally a budget-friendly option compared to some specialty coffee brands.

Having this large box, saves me from running back and forth to the grocery story. Read more | 5.0\nLove the flavor and test of this coffee.  Great quality! Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried McCafe Premium Roast K-Cup Pods for my Keurig, and I have to say, they’ve quickly become a favorite. Here’s my take on these coffee pods, including the pros and cons. Pros 1. Great Taste: The medium roast flavor is smooth and rich, not too strong or too mild. It’s a perfect balance that suits my morning routine perfectly. 2. Convenient: These single-serve pods are incredibly convenient. Just pop one into the Keurig, and you have a fresh cup of coffee in minutes with no mess or fuss. 3. Consistent Quality: Every cup tastes just as good as the last one. The quality is very consistent, which is something I really appreciate. 4. Large Quantity: The 84-count box is great for stocking up. It’s a cost-effective option that keeps me well-supplied for a long time. Cons 1. Packaging Waste: Like all single-serve pods, these generate more waste than traditional coffee methods. It’s something to consider if you’re environmentally conscious. 2. Price: While convenient, single-serve pods are generally more expensive per cup compared to ground coffee. However, the convenience often makes up for the extra cost. Conclusion McCafe Premium Roast K-Cup Pods are a fantastic choice for anyone looking for a convenient and consistently flavorful coffee option. The smooth, medium roast taste is perfect for daily enjoyment, and the large box is great for those who want to stock up. Despite the minor drawbacks, I highly recommend these coffee pods for Keurig users.

    "reviews": "If I could I would give THIS coffee concentrate 10 stars!! The first 2 times I purchased this coffee concentrate there was slight leakage. Nothing was broken, the foam piece of sealant over the top of the bottle leaked. All in all the Flavor and Quality of Jinx was Worth having to clean the bottle up the first 2 times!! I reviewed the product and I Continued to purchase. I received1 bottle in February No Leakage! Then I received my 2 new bottles on Subscribe & Save today, March 2nd, 2025;  and the Company (Jinx) LISTENED! Both new bottles arrived with not only No leakage, but they as a Company are started to put a plastic plug inside the bottle! THANK YOU! No mess to clean up, and no matter if you are paying for a viral concentrate (you’ll know the one lol) STOP! This is the REAL Deal!! It’s Flavorful, it’s Delicious, it’s a Great Quality and the Price is AMAZING!! I purchased these products with my own money Every month, sometimes twice a month, because now my Mother cannot believe how Great it tastes, and asks me to make her an iced coffee almost everyday lol! Her exact words “ I can’t believe you can make this iced coffee at home and get the actual Quality & Taste of the Big Chain iced coffee all at Home, AND look at how much money you’re saving!” If you’ve been looking for a Great Tasting, and Great Quality Coffee Concentrate to be able to customize your own drinks at home for a fraction of the cost while Not Compromising in any way and actually saving money-RUN-Order it now! Put it on Subscribe & Save like I did Save extra money, and never run out, I won’t! Thank You Jinx! Amazing Customer Service! Read more | 5.0\nWhen the coffee arrived I was hit with a strong coffee scent, and although it was wrapped in several layers of bubble wrap, it was leaking pretty badly. I couldn’t find a spot on the bottle that looked broken so my guess is that the company needs a better gasket underneath their lid. Since the leak seemed to be just a bad gasket and was still fully sealed, I tried it after washing off the bottle in the sink and I did enjoy it! I added the teaspoon of concentrate, which is what they recommend, some ice, filled most of the glass with milk then just added a little bit of cookie dough flavored Torani syrup and it tasted great, like an iced coffee I’d buy from a coffee shop. The actual quality of the stuff inside the bottle is great but the actual bottle needs some work and better leak protection. It’s so good though so I plan to buy again and give the packaging another chance Read more | 4.0\nIt tastes great no issues there. But… it leaked like 1/4 of the bottle, it was packaged good but it still leaked? I know it’s not the sellers problem, it’s a manufactures problem. I’m leaving 1 star due to losing a 1/4 bottle. Read more | 1.0\nProduct has a good strong taste and is easy and convenient to use. I was however disappointed that when it was delivered the product was damaged. I was only able to use a little of the product due to most of it being spilled inside the package. Read more | 3.0\nPretty good. It really is highly concentrated, so a bottle will go a long way. Tastes great too. It's a lot cheaper than other coffee concentrate bottles I've had or seen around. I can definitely see myself getting this again. I had an issue with seal breakage as others have mentioned, but Amazon covered it. Read more | 5.0\nDid not get to try because it was already cracked open and leaking all over the bottle and all of the package Had to throw the entire sticky mess away. No way to complain either. Read more | 2.0\nThe product tasted fresh and was super easy to use. I appreciated that it has only two ingredients. I simply mixed it into hot water using a Frech press and also make a cold brew with milk. Made it so easy and versatile to enjoy coffee fix on a whim. I did think the product tasted notably bitter, however. It's definitely ultra-concentrated. So I had to adjust to using a bit less of the concentrate. I also appreciated that it's unflavored so I could add other flavors in the amounts that I wanted. It does provide good long-lasting energy as well. Read more | 4.0\nI find that coffee concentrates like this can be bitter and leave an aftertaste. Not with Jinx! It has a great taste, a smooth finish, and hits the spot. No bitterness. Great for on the go, but it does need to be refrigerated after opening. Would recommend. Read more | 5.0",

Love the benefits of the mushrooms. 10/10 recommend! Read more | 5.0\nthis hot chocolate powder taste delicious. There are so many products that are just not right in their taste factor plus there is now the benefit of the mushrooms as part of it. We have enjoyed it in the evenings as part of our getting ready for bed routine. Read more | 5.0\n1 - Quantity - It's listed as 30 servings. I used a leveled measuring tool every time I served myself, and my container had 21.5 days worth of product. 2 - Flavor - My first impression was that it tastes like matcha with a hint of coffee, or matcha \"but bitter and dark.\" It's not a bad flavor. I don't like mushrooms, and I ordered this product as a way to have the health benefits of mushrooms, and to include them in my gut diversity. It still tastes enough like matcha, and after 3 weeks, I've grown to desire the flavor of this product. I drink it with a tbsp of oatmilk creamer. 3 - Quality - The texture is great. It dissolves quickly in hot water when stirred with a spoon, and almost instantly if you stir with a frother. Compared to RYZE, this has the mushrooms that matter most. 4 - Value - It's meh. Not getting 30 days is disappointing. It says full price is $39.99, but at the time of my purchase, it was only $24 for the subscription price. $24 for 21 days of product is $1.14 per serving. I'm more than content with that. Even if the price goes back up to $40, for 21 days, that's $1.90 per serving. I'm buying extra while it's on sale, because I do really like it. Read more | 4.0\nAs much as I love regular coffee, sometimes you need something quick for on-the-go. Looking for an instant coffee that gives additional health benefits, I picked this up on a whim. I was pleased from the first sip! I make mine cold with milk and the flavor is so rich and creamy. Yes, it has a nutty, mushroom-y flavor, but I don't mind that as I like mushrooms and it isn't overwhelming. And having tried other mushroom coffees and cocoas, I can say that the Om products are the best tasting I've found so far. It does take some work to dissolve, so you'll want to use more than just a spoon to mix. I use a milk frother and that works perfectly. If you're in the market for an instant mushroom latte mix, I can't recommend this one enough! Read more | 5.0\nI love I’m! Regulates me and tastes good. Gives me more energy and keeps my mood better!

It tastes so good on its own and most of the time I just drink it how it is. Sometimes I will add a little cream and that is delicious also. Highly recommend :) Read more | 5.0\nI've been ordering the Coffee Latte Blend for a few years now and it was my daily, go-to AM drink. Recently, I ordered more of Coffee Latte blend and when it arrived I noticed the packaging was different. The packaging was always a round, cardboard container with a plastic sleeve inside that held the powdered mix. The Coffee Latte that I received was in a Plastic canister with a screw-top lid. I didn't think much of it, and continued as I normally would making my AM coffee. It tasted AWFUL. I turned the new canister around to check the label, and sat it side-by-side with the old (good) Coffee Latte mix and found that there are several ingredient changes - NONE of which are noted online. The old Coffee Latte was a blend of Lion's Mane, Cordyceps, Reishi, and Chaga. The new canister is missing Reishi and Chaga. In addition, the old Coffee Latte used Maple Sugar Powder (missing from the new one) as well as Vanilla (also missing from the new one). I've posted pictures of the canisters side-by-side. You can see a clear differences in the ingredients used, and none of the changes are disclosed online. The OLD (better) product is still marketed, but the new product is being distributed in it's place. I'll return the new Coffee Latte I've purchased and try to source the older packaged Coffee Latte locally in stores before it's completely sold out. The new stuff sucks. Why ruin a good thing?

    "reviews": "Orange d'Or Miami Punch Berry Copa Crush Limón Lime League Mas+ by Messi is hands down one of the best hydration drinks I've tried. The flavor is crisp, refreshing, and actually enjoyable - no artificial aftertaste or overpowering sweetness. Without excess sugar or caffeine found in other sports drinks this is great whether post-workout or just for daily hydration. If you're looking for a clean, better-for-you option that doesn't compromise on taste for your family, this is it! Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the blue Berry Copa Crush Mas + since my boys are big fans of Leo Messi. They were so excited and they absolutely love the drink. It's very refreshing when they have sports events. Keeps them hydrated without a lot of calories and no artificial sweeteners. I've been told I need to order more and they want to try the other 3 flavors. Thanks Leo Messi for coming with this great drink. Read more | 5.0\nI really love this drink. Such a flavorful drink and love to see how clean the ingredients are! Keeps me hydrated whether it’s after a work out or just trying to hit my daily goal of water intake. The electrolytes are a plus too! Read more | 5.0\nThe stevia flavor is pretty pronounced in this, although it does say it has 1g of cane sugar in it too as a sweetener. The berry flavor is good but the stevia just kind of detracts from it a little bit. However, I know some will prefer that it has stevia because it's natural, so I can't rag on it too much. The nutrition facts look pretty comparable to other sports drinks. It's currently priced at $23 and change for 12 bottles, which is pricey, but I recognize that part of that is paying for the name/endorsement of Messi, so take that as you will. My rating scale: 1 star:  Horrible product. If I had paid for this, I would be upset. 2 stars: Pretty bad but not quite horrible. I would not reorder. 3 stars: Just ok. It could have been better, but it also could have been worse. ****4 stars: Good! A solid product that met my expectations.***** 5 stars: Very good and/or a great value! I would definitely reorder.

The favors are subtle, but you can tell the difference.  You can open the box in the side to use that to hold them – I didn’t realize this until I had torn the box open.

I'd definitely recommend this to any coffee lover. Read more | 5.0\nFantastic coffee! Purchased the Seattle Dark version.

Read more | 5.0\nThe Victor Allen Coffee Caramel Macchiato Single Serve K-Cups offer a convenient and tasty option for those who enjoy flavored coffee. With 80 K-Cups in a pack, it provides a cost-effective choice for daily use with Keurig 2.0 brewers. The caramel macchiato flavor is pleasant and satisfying, providing a smooth and mildly sweet coffee experience. It offers a nice balance between the coffee's boldness and the subtle caramel notes, making it an enjoyable treat to savor. The packaging variation is not an issue for me, as the taste and quality seem consistent regardless of the packaging design. However, my experience with this product has been a bit inconsistent in terms of flavor and strength. While some K-Cups produce a rich and flavorful cup of coffee, others can taste slightly weak or diluted. This inconsistency is disappointing, as I never know if I'll get a perfectly satisfying cup or one that falls a bit flat. I also noticed that some K-Cups had a tendency to leak or drip during the brewing process, leading to some waste and mess. Moreover, I have a personal preference for coffee that uses natural or high-quality flavorings rather than artificial additives. Although the caramel macchiato flavor is enjoyable, I can't help but wonder about the ingredients used to achieve it. In conclusion, the Victor Allen Coffee Caramel Macchiato Single Serve K-Cups offer a convenient and flavorful option for Keurig 2.0 brewers. The caramel macchiato flavor is enjoyable, providing a mild sweetness that complements the coffee well. However, the inconsistency in flavor and strength, as well as occasional leaking during brewing, are drawbacks that prevent me from giving this product a higher rating. If you enjoy flavored coffee and don't mind occasional variations in taste, this pack could still be a suitable choice. Three stars for a product that delivers a decent caramel macchiato experience, but with some room for improvement in consistency and quality. Read more | 3.0\nVictor Allen never disappoints.

This is my review on This is my review on Victor Allen's Coffee Italian Roast Capsules, Single Serve Coffee Pods (Pack of 1), 0.02 pounds | Dark Roast | 42 Count | Keurig K-Cup Brewers As an avid coffee enthusiast and a dedicated shopper on the hunt for the perfect Italian Roast, I came across this remarkable find that has genuinely exceeded my expectations. Like many other shoppers, I was looking for a quality coffee that wouldn't break the bank, and I can confidently say that this one hits all the right notes. From the moment I opened the bag, I was greeted by an enticing aroma that promised a rich flavor experience. Brewing this Italian Roast is not just a routine; it's a delightful ritual. The aroma fills my kitchen, creating an inviting atmosphere that sets the tone for the day. Each sip offers a robust and well-balanced taste, capturing the essence of a traditional Italian coffee experience. The flavor profile is rich without being overwhelming, and I find it perfectly suited for any time of day—whether it's a morning boost or an afternoon pick-me-up. One of the standout aspects of this coffee is the affordability. It feels like a small luxury that doesn't come with a hefty price tag. It's rare to find such quality coffee at a reasonable price, especially for an Italian Roast, which is often associated with higher-end offerings. This product truly bridges the gap between quality and cost, making it accessible for all coffee lovers. If there's one drawback, it’s simply that I wish they offered this incredible roast in larger quantities. I find myself reaching for it frequently, and it would be fantastic to stock up without worrying about running out too quickly. Nevertheless, this small wish doesn’t detract from my overall appreciation of the product. In conclusion, if you’re in search of a fantastic Italian Roast coffee that delivers on flavor and affordability, look no further! This coffee has quickly become a staple in my kitchen, and I wholeheartedly recommend it to anyone with a passion for rich coffee experiences. I can’t wait for them to expand the offering to larger quantity, but until then, I’ll be savoring every cup! Read more | 5.0\nSo far, I've really enjoyed these coffee pods. The Variety Pack is a delight, offering different flavors for every mood. The Single Serve Pods are incredibly convenient - just pop one in and you're good to go. I particularly loved the Morning Blend Flavor; it's mild yet flavorful, perfect for starting the day. Definitely a high-quality set for coffee enthusiasts! Read more | 5.0\nI bought 4 boxes of 42 pods each. One box, batch# LC 101 052724 plugged my coffee maker almost ~75% of the time. I cleaned it each time, made sure the puncture device as clear. Again, almost all of them plugged my coffee maker, more than few times i had a sludge in the bottom of my coffee cup, and grounds floating in my coffee cup. One time, it completely dumped the entire contents of the pod into my coffee cup. Lots of sludge and grounds that time, the pod was totally empty of anything. This is the second time in a few years of buying these that this has happened. Hopefully the shipper can notify the quality assurance department of Victor Allen. A one off on occassion is one thing, but having 25-30 out of 42 is not a good thing and gets expensive. I also verified by buying a local brand, and they ALL worked just fine and made good coffee. One more time with Victor Allen and I will be done with them. Update on 1-23-2025, 5 out of 6 pods dumped grounds into my coffee cup today. Not looking too good. 02-06-25, I had a run of about 10 pods that were good, but now I am having them blow out again. 0 stars for this as I have read multiple reviews of people having the same issues with this brand. The company, Amazon nor VA seems to read these reviews and respond, so I am no longer buying their products, and will reiterate the 0 STARS for this product. Update 02-12-2025. Contacted Victor Allen direct via email, recieved a canned response requesting pics, sent pics, recieved 4 boxes 42ea. with an apology for dissatisfaction. I will see if these pods will be any better, but at least I recieved a response. Will update after I use the new ones. Read more | 3.0\nI really dig this coffee. I get the 4-variety pack. The only flavor I'm neutral on is the morning blend but I still drink it without any thought about it. The other 3 are great in my opinion. Excellent flavors.

    "reviews": "It tastes like the best cup of Columbia’s coffee with no hints of anything else, I add half and half. Took cup one and in less than half an hour felt more energy, more alert and I got off the sofa  and did chores til dark.I wanted something that was healthy and gave me energy, this worked for me. Price is better than most,. dissolves instantly and completely, no during or after taste, elevated my mood, energy and concentration, I had one morning cup and zero side effects. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried this coffee mushroom and I’m impressed! This instant coffee is infused with Lion’s Mane, Chaga, Reishi, Cordyceps, and more, offering a natural boost without the jitters or crash of regular coffee. Smooth & earthy taste – not too strong, but still satisfying Steady energy & focus – perfect for long work sessions Gut-friendly & packed with immune-supporting mushrooms If you’re looking for a healthier coffee alternative, this is definitely worth trying! The taste takes a little getting used to, but the benefits make up for it!! Read more | 5.0\nI was skeptical at first, but this organic mushroom instant coffee completely surprised me! It blends rich, smooth coffee flavor with the added benefits of medicinal mushrooms like lion’s mane and chaga. Unlike some other mushroom coffees, this one doesn’t have an overpowering earthy taste—just a subtle nuttiness that complements the coffee beautifully. The convenience is a huge plus. It dissolves quickly in hot water, making it perfect for busy mornings or travel. I also noticed a more sustained energy boost without the jitters or crash that regular coffee sometimes gives me. It’s a great choice for anyone looking to cut back on caffeine but still enjoy a bold, satisfying cup. Overall, I highly recommend this if you’re open to trying a healthier alternative to regular coffee. The adaptogenic benefits and smooth taste make it a worthwhile addition to any daily routine! Read more | 5.0\nAfter one cup got used to, and liked, taste. Slight mushroom taste but not overpowering, taste the coffee. Hits the mark on: ORGANIC, NO SUGAR--I saw one that uses Stevia, which I find too sweet (If you need a sweetener: great alternative is Allulose: 1:1  to sugar, no aftertaste, plant-based, doesn't impact blood sugar.) And HEALTH BENEFITS. Most important to me: Alertness, energy and doesn't impact gastro (I have acid reflux) Not 5 stars because of hefty price $30. I bought it by accident but love it: If you can afford $1/cup for coffee made at home or want to splurge and 1 cup a day is all you want go for it. At $1/cup and only getting 30 cups, it's a chunk of change (I have 1 cup and then a regular coffee if I want another cup). I just found one for $20 with a good review that gives 90 cups--so even if want to add more mushroom coffee powder, it's still cheaper. Will see how it compares Read more | 4.0\nThis Mushroom Coffee is a game-changer! With 90 servings of organic, instant coffee, it’s packed with 7 superfoods, including Lion’s Mane, Chaga, and Reishi, providing a natural energy boost without the jitters. The Colombian coffee taste is smooth and delicious, and it fits perfectly into my keto routine. I love that it’s easy to prepare and gives me a focused, clean energy throughout the day. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a healthier coffee alternative! Read more | 5.0\nTaste good which was surprising. i took 2 servings a day and was easy to drink down with honey and cream. also good value for amount of servings. However ,the issue at hand is that i did not see ANY of the benefits and thats taking 2 full servings daily 6 hours apart! Read more | 3.0\nAs much as I love the taste of coffee, I usually stray away because of the feeling of indigestion that comes with it. I decided to try out this mushroom coffee blend with the hope that all its nutritional benefits would outweigh the costs. Little did I know I would get the enjoyable taste plus the best midday feeling I’ve had in a while! It’s exactly what I need to make that last push to the end of the workday. It mixes well with a mug of hot water (or cold if you have a little more patience), and since it doesn’t come in a giant tub like some other supplemental powders, it travels and stores easy! This container will last me a while, but I’ll definitely be ordering again. Read more | 5.0\nI've been shopping around for some time for a good mushroom coffee, something that had both Lion's Mane and Shiitake (this one actually has a total of 7 extracts), and I'm glad I found this one. I usually take mushroom supplements separately, so I figured why not take them with my coffee. I'm pretty happy with this coffee so far. I usually drink Nescafe Classico instant, and this coffee has a pretty similar taste. I was initially concerned the mushrooms might make it taste a bit weird, but it has a pretty smooth taste, although I would recommend adding some sugar and creamer if you are not used to drinking black coffee like me. One immediate positive effect I noticed was that I didn't have my normal post coffee crash as I do with other coffees. I also drink this in the afternoon and it helps to clear up my mid-day fatigue and make me more alert, without affecting my sleep from drinking PM coffee. A cool bonus is the container actually comes with a measuring spoon for the recommend serving (you may have to dig a little inside the container to find it, as mine was on the bottom of the all the coffee). Overall I would recommend this coffee if you are looking for a mushroom coffee blend, and I plan to order this again. Read more | 5.0",

Buy a case you will not be disappointed at all!! Read more | 5.0\nBloom Sparkling Energy Drink is a game-changing, natural energy drink that delivers a refreshing, sustained energy boost. With its adaptogenic botanicals, essential vitamins and minerals, and delicious flavors, I highly recommend it to anyone seeking a healthier, more effective energy drink solution. Read more | 5.0\nThese drinks provide me with great energy and have great flavor (peach mango and raspberry lemon are my fav). I wish they would formulate 1-2 flavors with out sucralose (monk fruit ideally) for those of us who are health/ingredient conscious. 180 mg is a lot of caffeine for myself, i wish they had the half can option (like alani nu) for when someone just needs a little boost, wants the energy in the afternoon, or for those who are caffeine sensitive. Overall i much prefer this brand to other brands, however i would not drink them daily due to their limitations. Read more | 4.0\nThis was my first time trying bloom.

I recently discovered these as an energy drink option, and I immediately loved the two flavors I tried (Juicy Orange and Strawberry Watermelon), so I wanted to try some others!

It's an awesome price and it taste just as good if not better than the store brand. The scent isn't as intense as the store brand which is great for my roommate who doesn't like coffee. I just ordered this one type and I'm going to buy some again when I get low. The coffee was fresh, no complaints at all. Read more | 5.0\nCheap pods, and good coffee.  I’m far from a connoisseur of coffee.  So take that into consideration. I did complain about the packaging.  Must have been a mishap at the company because coffee was dumped all in the box and fell through the packaging box.  I had coffee all over and had to wipe down each pod. No pods broken in box.  So it was packaged like this from manufacturer. Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "Immune + Defend Energy + Focus Burn + Control Alone, it doesn’t taste good.  Add suger free flavors and this stuff really works.  I am not hungry at all. I lost over 20lbs. I recommend this to everyone. Read more | 5.0\nI wonder who the reviewers writing such crap think we customers are? Do they think we are stupid enough to believe what they are saying? Like this reviewer who rated Javita 5 stars yet wrote two lines ? Or the other who said:'So far I've been drinking it for a month and I'm down 22 lbs\" ... No way  anyone can lose weight whether it is 4 lb a week or 6 just by drinking Javita coffee !! Javita is great , true... I discovered it a few weeks ago and I bought it on Amazon. The reason I bought it is because i used to buy fat burner Garcinia Cambogia tablets and also rasberry ketones on Amazon.This coffee also is made of Garcinia Cambogia ... While you drink coffee you lose body fat. I read a lot about Garcinia Cambogia and Rasberry ketones both acting as fat burner and help with losing weight... That is true, but noone is going to lose weight just by taking those tablets or drinking that Javita coffee! Let me be clear on that... Unless some metabolisms are prone to lose weight in a quicker way...but not mine... As I live in the middle east, when I first ordered the rasberry ketones and Garcinia Cambogia they were confiscated by the local health authorities and they were not released to me until their lab tested and analysed them. They are safe to use, as not all labs make such healthy supplements, you have to be careful from which manufacturer you buy these supplements. Mine were bought on Amazon and I think that is somehow a garantee you get good quality products, and the labs where they were made are renowned: Research Verified,and GSD & Company,inc. To go back to the coffee, it is true that it helps burn fat and lose weight, but you also need to exercise at leat 30 mn a day (walk, jog or whatever activity). I have been on a diet through a dietician since first November 2014 and up to date lost 20 kg... I exercise 6 days a week , follow a diet and take those tablets and javita coffee. What is also true, since I started taking Javita i have noticed that my body fat is reduced by the double...my dietician weighs me every week and his automatic weighing machine generate a detailed report on total weight, extra cellular water, protein ,minerals and body fat...I have noticed that the body fat loss was double since I started taking Javita. I drink  2 coffees a day one in the morning and one in the evening. This I can guarantee you is true... But whether it will work for everybody , that I cannot say... All you have to do is try... I have all my weekly weight detailed reports and can email them to you to prove that, but not all bodies are the same and respond to the same supplement or treatment in the same way. The coffee itself tastes great.... Read more | 5.0\nI didn’t see any benefits from the coffee as far as weight, but it did not cause morning jitters nor did it cause the caffeine exhaustions early in the afternoon.  I did seem to have more prolonged energy.  I bought twice. I might buy again in the future because it would be handy for a trip. Read more | 4.0\nI was bummed because I tried this coffee years ago and I wanted to try it again.  But after 2x ordering it and  drinking the whole box thought the weeks I have noticed no difference in my weight. Therefore this supplement coffee is way to expensive than regular coffee for no effect. Also I find it deceptive that they don't mention \"Caffeine Anhydrous\" is in the ingredients list so just be aware of that. I have supplied a good picture of the full ingredient list. It tasted ok when I added all my extras to it but unfortunately I'm not planning to get it again. It didn't give me any seeming bad effects as others stated for them, but it just wasn't good enough effective to support cost either. Not organic to my knowledge.  Anyways. Hope it works for you. :) Read more | 3.0\nI received it in July 8th and it's august 13. After the first cup, few things: - The energy is obvious. Note that I am not a coffee person so my reaction was raw. A lot of energy from 11am to about 5pm. - Suppressed my appetite. Even if I eat I can't even finish one half of a baby carrot Fast forward after a week. - The energy effect still strong - The appetite suppressant effect still in effect At this point I started training so I had to force myself to eat something because it does give me energy but after that my body is pretty strained. So I decided to start taking it at 2pm. Morning I eat if I can because this coffee helped me regulate my eating habits. so the effects: - I am able to sleep better after my workouts. This doesn't make you lose sleep - I don't feel any stomach pain, headache or the tingling preworkout stuff usually gives you - it is very gentle on the body yet very effective Fast forward after a month - my body has gotten used to the routine - the coffee still has the strong effect on me - I eat less and enjoy making meals now. Since I don't need to eat a lot anymore it's easier to eat healthier - Obviously I lost a lot of weight. I don't like the scale so I rarely weight myself but to give an idea went from 154 to 137lbs. Not sure if it's water weight of fat but I am leaner (I also started working out but I shed faster with something like this coffee in addition) I am not bulky but stronger. More compact you can say. In conclusion this coffee to me is a tool I use to control my eating habits (I tend to snack a lot) it also gave me the energy I didn't know I needed. I don't think it is addictive. I feel like it kind of educate your body. I am more than impressed with the purchase Update: it is now january 2022 I had to put whoever needed the boost of energy and shed few weight on. I restarted my martial art journey and from time to time I also was falling ill. This really helped me stay on my 2 feet (though I'd advice against using it to recover illness because it's caffeine and you need more vitamins and multivitamin to strengthen your immune system) Never the less I have never looked back since. This is the only coffee I take. Not everyday but days I feel like my body needs a little jolt of energy instantly!! It sends you to the bathroom if your guts were messed up so I have been able to control my weight and oscillate between 135 and 144 now. I would like to keep it at 135 but my silhouette is the same eitherway. This is a winner Read more | 5.0\nGood coffee. Great service. Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n3.0\n2.0\n5.0\n1.0",

    "reviews": "Skinny Margarita Passionfruit Paloma Variety Strawberry Mule Mint Mojito Margarita Variety Pack Mango Margarita Holiday Variety Cranberry Vanilla Classic Margarita Blueberry Lemonade Blood Orange Mai Tai Black Cherry Old Fashioned Apple Cider Espresso Martini I recently tried Craftmix drink packets and was pleasantly surprised by their variety and flavor profiles. I experimented with four different mixes: Blood Orange Mai Tai, Passionfruit Paloma, Mango Margarita, and Strawberry Mule, using both vodka and creating mocktails for some refreshing non-alcoholic options. Here’s how each one turned out: **Blood Orange Mai Tai:** This was a standout for me! The flavor was vibrant and citrusy, perfectly capturing the essence of a classic Mai Tai. It had a nice balance of sweetness and tartness when paired with rum. As a mocktail, it was refreshing on its own, with a lovely blood orange flavor that really shined. **Passionfruit Paloma:** The Passionfruit Paloma was another winner. The tropical notes of passionfruit combined with a hint of lime were refreshing, but I found that it paired exceptionally well with vodka instead of tequila. It brought out the zesty flavors and made for a great summer drink. As a mocktail, it still felt indulgent and flavorful, perfect for gatherings. **Mango Margarita:** If you love mango, this mix is fantastic! The Mango Margarita was rich and fruity, definitely reminiscent of lounging on a beach. Mixed with tequila, it became a delicious cocktail that I could sip all afternoon. The mocktail version was just as delightful, delivering that lime punch without any alcohol. **Strawberry Mule:** Last but not least, the Strawberry Mule was a refreshing twist on the classic Moscow Mule. The strawberry flavor was prominent but not overpowering. I enjoyed it best with vodka and ginger beer, which beautifully accented the ginger spice. The mocktail version was equally enjoyable, making it a versatile option for any occasion. Overall, I was impressed with how easy these Craftmix packets made to create delicious drinks. Each flavor delivered an authentic taste, and I appreciated the option to enjoy them with or without alcohol. Go heavy on the tonic water and ice to diffuse the sweetness. Add fruit to each drink, rest for a few minutes, then enjoy. Great for parties, summer gatherings, or just a quiet night in. I’d highly recommend Craftmix to anyone looking to elevate their drink game without the fuss of complicated recipes! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve previously bought the variety pack and was very impressed. This blueberry lemonade is amazing.  You can taste the blueberries but it’s not too tart.  It was very easy to use. Instructions were to use with vodka but I think rum would also go great. I love that it’s also lower calorie. That being said it does have a fake sugar taste like all “zero sugar “ stuff.  Definitely would buy again. Read more | 5.0\nThe Blueberry Lemonade may now be my new favorite flavor of Craftmix! It tastes just how you would expect. A classic blueberry lemonade but it’s not overly tart, which I prefer! I love keeping craft mix in my purse because I’m not a person that loves a normal bar mixed drink. These make it so easy to order a vodka water or vodka tonic and easily add it to my drink for that signature cocktail feel without the added price, or calories. I also gave craft mix to the girls for my bachelorette trip and it made for a great addition to their gift! I will definitely be repurchasing this flavor again! Read more | 5.0\nI recently discovered Craftmix cocktail packets, and they’ve completely changed the way I enjoy mixed drinks at home or I can pack them for a trip/flight. These little packets are perfect for anyone who loves a flavorful cocktail but wants to skip the hassle of sugary mixers. My personal favorite is the Passionfruit Paloma flavor—it's tropical, tangy, and perfectly balanced. While it’s great when mixed with tequila, I’ve found that it’s just as delicious with club soda for a refreshing, alcohol-free option. It satisfies my craving for something fruity without the sugar overload that traditional cocktail mixers bring. Each packet is easy to use—just mix with water, club soda, or your preferred spirit, and you have a perfectly blended drink in seconds. The natural flavors shine through, making it a great way to enjoy a cocktail (or mocktail) without feeling guilty about excessive sugar. This would make a great gift or stocking stuffer as well! Read more | 4.0\nI ordered a bunch of assorted craftmix mixers for a friend’s bachelorette party a few months back and they went over without a hitch. They’re perfect for easy, quick, and delicious on the go cocktails with great flavor and minimal prep work. After trying this blueberry lemonade, I have to say it’s probably my favorite my though. I’m currently pregnant so I couldn’t enjoy it with alcohol but I’m sure it’s even more tasty with some. Definitely going to be ordering more for an upcoming bachelorette trip in April! The quality of their products paired with the cost is honestly unmatched. 10/10 recommend. Read more | 5.0\nThese are very easy to use to make a quick drinks. My first packet was Cranberry Vanilla. With prep with vodka and water there was a slight cough medicine taste, but adding simple syrup and a touch of lime greatly helped. The espresso martini was delicious and the coffee was solid. I added a touch of caramel to sweeten. My favorite was the spiked apple cider. With some elderflower liqueur, it was amazing and I would purchase this one again. Read more | 5.0\nThe perfect gift idea!!! I was super impressed with the Blueberry Lemonade Craftmix! It was so convenient to bring out with me to the bar, and made me feel better about my drink choice since it was a healthier alternative to higher sugar drinks. This flavor definitely is my favorite one that I have tried so far!! Read more | 5.0\nThis holiday variety pack is fantastic for making quick, delicious cocktails or mocktails! The mixers are made with real fruit, are low-sugar, vegan, and free of allergens like gluten and dairy. They're super easy to mix and perfect for parties or cozy nights in.

    "reviews": "If you’re an East Coast Sheetz fan, you probably felt personally attacked when they got rid of the frozen Kona Mocha. Well, guess what? This is it. Identical taste, no road trip required. Honestly, I wish I had discovered this sooner—it’s ridiculously low-cost per serving, which means I can now feed my addiction without breaking the bank. It’s perfect for lazy days when I just want iced coffee, but the real magic happens when I bust out the blender for that frozen, creamy goodness. The measurements are spot-on, so there’s zero guesswork—just pure mocha joy every time. The only downside? The smaller bags are always sold out, probably because everyone else figured this out before I did. If you’ve been mourning the loss of Sheetz’s Kona Mocha, consider this your official sign to stock up. You’ll thank me later! Read more | 5.0\nPumpkin spice iced drink mix was the bomb. It was great, very flavorful and smelt amazing. It mixed well and was very easy to make. The quality was very good: a fine blend and it didn't take much to make great drinks. I'm very happy with my purchase. Def recommend Read more | 5.0\nThis is the best tasting chai. You can easily make delicious chai drinks at home for the fraction of the cost! There is a lot of sugar in in, but it's perfect for an occasional pick me up! This will last you a while, so it's a great value! Read more | 5.0\nI've never been much of a coffee drinker but I would occasionally purchase a frozen frappucino from various places (Starbucks, McDonalds, etc). Then one day I had a frozen Kona Mocha at Sheetz and I was instantly hooked. It had such a distinct, unique flavor that was unlike any of the others out there and I couldn't get enough. The only problem was the price. If you buy one at Sheetz, you'll end up spending over $4 for one (and theirs are small compared to other places). When I went online looking for a recipe on how to make one at home, to save a little money, I stumbled upon this stuff from Big Train. I decided to give it a try because all the ingredients matched up to Sheetz's online ingredients list. Well, let me tell you, they match up for a reason - it's EXACTLY the same. I couldn't believe it. I knew it was the second I opened it because it smelled the same. All you do is blend the powder, ice (I add just a little more than the bag says to, to make it slightly thicker) and milk (I always got almond milk at Sheetz, so that's what I use at home) and it's done. It's fine just the way that is, but because I've been adding caramel every time I buy one at Sheetz, I also add a tablespoon and a half of caramel sauce, too (just the cheap Hershey's kind). The ones at Sheetz also come with whipped cream on top and chocolate drizzle, but that was never that important to me. The bag will make approximately 20 of the Sheetz-sized drinks, so by buying this powder from Big Train, you can easily make frozen Kona Mochas at home for AT LEAST half the price, if not less. Though, to be honest, even though I initially hoped this would help me save money by not having to buy them at Sheetz once or twice a week anymore, I have a feeling, with them being SO good, tasting exactly the same and being so easy to make, I think I might end up spending the same every week anyway, but just having them a lot more frequently now that I found this product from Big Train. I highly recommend it. It's fantastic! EDIT: I've downgraded my rating by one star, not because of the product but because of its packaging/handling. I subscribed to get monthly shipments and my first shipment (the second bag I've ordered) arrived with a nick about an inch long in the bag, causing it to leak powder in the box. Because it's something edible, I didn't take any chances and decided not to use it and got a replacement. It's supposed to arrive in a couple days. I noticed a couple other people have experienced the same issue. I hope this was just a one time thing and I won't experience it again. I'll post again about its condition when my replacement comes. To be continued... UPDATE: My third bag (replacement for second that was damaged) arrived and it was fine. There WAS a small opening in the bottom seam of the bag (probably less than a quarter of an inch), but it was very small (a tiny bit of powder came out only after I lifted it up; there wasn't any in the box itself) and it appeared to just be a natural opening, from the weight/pressure of the powder. When I opened the bag all the way along that same side, the seam appeared to have been sealed all the way across (the grooves were all the way across on both sides), it just naturally opened slightly. The bags are filled with a lot of powder (3.5 pounds is a lot heavier than you'd think) and it must have just caused the seal to break during packing or shipment (or even when I lifted the bag up?). I've been enjoying it since it arrived and it tastes fine (and hasn't made me sick or any thing). I still feel like I need to examine each bag that arrives, but hopefully the bad experiences in the future (if any) will outweigh the good ones. I still highly recommend this product. It's fantastic. I also recommend dividing the powder up when you get it and put each portion in baggies to make it easier when getting ready to blend one up. UPDATE #2: My second monthly shipment arrived today in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings. UPDATE #3: I ran out of my second monthly bag before my third (I'm getting another family member hooked on this delicious stuff) so I ordered an extra one. It came in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings. I'll update again when my third monthly shipment arrives in a couple weeks. UPDATE #4: My third monthly shipment arrived today in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings. UPDATE #5: My fourth monthly shipment arrived today. It was the first time it was shipped in a bubble envelope as opposed to a box, which made me really nervous. LUCKILY, I opened it and the bag was in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings, but if they are going to be sending them like this from now on, I'm more concerned than before that something might happen. Hopefully nothing will. Also, if you're unsure whether your bag has an opening anywhere in it or not, believe me, you'll know the second you open the box or envelope, not because you'll necessarily see some of the powder in the box or a noticeable hole in the bag but because the Kona Mocha has such a strong, distinctive smell, you'll smell it right away. So, use your nose as a test, too. If you don't smell anything, it's probably sealed and safe. UPDATE #6: My fifth monthly shipment arrived today in perfect condition - no holes, tears, cuts or openings. This one arrived in a box with bubble wrap for protection (much better than the bubble envelope they used previously). Also, I had ordered an extra bag a little over two weeks ago and it arrived (even with a couple other things in the box) in perfect condition as well. Since I haven't had any issues in a while, I've been happy with my purchases every time since those minor issues happened, and I don't want this review to reach some length limit, I will leave this as it is and only update it from now on when or if an issue ever arises again. Thanks for taking the time to read this review and I hope it helped you decide to purchase some of this great Kona Mocha coffee drink mix. I still highly recommend it. Read more | 4.0\nIt's a nice drink mix, it has a nice light cocoa flavor with a hint of spice.  You add more or less mix to get the taste that works for you.  I use 4 level spoons myself in hot water.  Great for helping warm up on chilly days.  I drink it year round but more on cooler days.  It's not coffee and it's not tea tea, it's its on thing.  I was introduced to it by a friend about 5 years ago and I'm glad they did.  I enjoy it, obviously. Read more | 5.0\nWith how prices are right now, I can’t afford to spend 8 dollars every other day on a Starbucks chai with extra caramel drizzle. So I bought this so I could just make it at home. The price is a bit high, but for the amount you get it can still last you for a long while depending on how often you drink the stuff! The taste is delicious on its own and with the added syrups I put in it, it tastes better than the drinks I get from Starbucks! You only really need one scoop I bought this in January and I still have more than enough even though it’s been a couple of months! Granted I only drink this a couple times a week, but it still surprises me how long this can keep you going! Will definitely order again along with other flavors they have Read more | 5.0\nI love it! A lot of reviews say it’s too sweet, but I disagree. I’m the kind of person to add some sugar to my tea, and the sweetness of this is perfect. However per the ingredients it IS mostly sugar. The taste isn’t super strong on the chai, but it tastes like what you would get at dunkin or Dutch bros, which is great! Definitely recommend, but be aware of the amount of sugar in this. Read more | 5.0\nThe Spiced Chai is amazing, but there is so much sugar. Using the recommended amount has an amazing flavor but by the end of the cup my stomach hurts from all the sugar. If I use less of the mix, the flavor isn't strong enough and the drink tastes watered down. I would love to see a low-sugar version EDIT: I ordered the \"No Sugar Added\" Vanilla Chai and it clumps like dollar store hot chocolate mix. No idea why it's so bad with clumping as the \"normal\" chai I purchased before had no clumping at all. I have to stir it with a fork for a solid 60+ seconds to get the chunks to mostly break up. Dropping review to 3 stars because Amazon won't let me review these products separately.

I have a small Ninja blender that can blen ice. This is sooo good! It has more coffee flavor than the Frappe but I am not complaining because it is just right. I am almost ready to begin using my second bag. Read more | 5.0\nI buy this product regularly and have done so for many years.  I found it in a coffee/donut shop as their mocha option and then later found the same flavor being used at a marketplace stall.  (I was sneaky at the shop and got a look at what powder product they were using as they wanted to keep it a secret.)  I was relieved when I found this product was available thru Amazon.  There can be issues with the flavor and that is because of the amount of ice you use (I recommend experimenting).  Also the milk or milk substitute you use will affect the flavor.  If you're able and it's fine for you, stick with the instructions, but otherwise feel free to try your non-dairy milk substitutes.  I go for almond, myself.  It's a delicate but not heavy mocha flavor. Read more | 5.0\nI spent years trying to find a mix that works well with Milk or Water.

    "reviews": "Vanilla Chocolate Peanut Butter Cafe Latte I've been on the hunt for a protein shake that balances taste with nutrition, and Premier Protein’s Chocolate Peanut Butter shake nails it! With 30g of protein packed into each bottle, it’s perfect for post-workouts, a quick breakfast, or even a snack that actually keeps me full. The taste is a big win for me. Some protein shakes can be chalky or overly sweet, but this has a smooth, rich flavor that tastes like a treat without feeling heavy. The chocolate and peanut butter combo is exactly what you’d hope for—it’s indulgent but not overpowering, and there’s no weird aftertaste. I also love that it has only 1g of sugar, which makes it a go-to when I'm watching my carbs. On the convenience side, it’s a grab-and-go lifesaver. I don’t always have time to prepare a full meal, so this shake has become my reliable backup. Plus, it’s loaded with vitamins and minerals like calcium and vitamin D, adding a nice nutritional boost. If you’re looking for a protein shake that delivers on flavor, nutrition, and convenience, Premier Protein’s Chocolate Peanut Butter flavor is definitely worth a try!

    "reviews": "i have been using Starbucks Premium Instant Coffee, for a few years now and I must say, it exceeded my expectations for an instant coffee. The convenience of having a quick cup without compromising on flavor is a huge plus. The coffee has a rich, full-bodied taste that closely resembles the freshly brewed experience you get at a Starbucks café. The aroma is inviting, and the smooth texture makes for an enjoyable drinking experience. It's perfect for those busy mornings or when you're on the go and need a quick caffeine fix. I also appreciate that it dissolves easily in both hot and cold water, making it versatile for different coffee preferences.

It also has microground coffee which hides most of that instant taste. Has chocolate notes you can taste. I'm doing a 242 mile kayak trip over 21 days. Instant coffee is fast and convenient and takes up less space than ground coffee and maker. It will never replace the bold rich flavor of brewed coffee, but it's really close. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "I only do esspresso shots with a little bit of sweetness like adding condensed milk. Sometimes some soy but minimal like a traditional macchiato. I like my coffee on a more smooth, sweet taste and this hits the spot. I found this thru a subscription, and was happy finding this on here to buy. 2lbs seems like a lot but it’s worth it if you enjoy this coffee. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the Bark at the Moon dark roast coffee whole beans and was looking forward to as they describe - The rich flavors of dark chocolate and caramel drizzle coupled with a caramel-like aftertaste. This blend is the outdoor lover's dark roast. It captures the spirit of adventure with the fresh taste of the wild keeping you barking until the moon rises. Unfortunately, I can't do a review on that blend because I'm pretty sure that I received the other blend called Hell Yeah, medium roast beans. (See pictures of Front labels) Besides not tasting like the Bark at the Moon description, or looking like dark roast, the labels on the front of the bag represent the Hell Yeah blend. However, the label on the back indicates the Bark at the Moon blend (See picture). So, I will go ahead and review the Hell Yeah - medium roast that the product description states that it Tastes Like Swiss Chocolate, Macadamia Nut, Sweet, since I'm pretty sure that's what I got. Opening the bag for the first time, I got a good whiff of some nice smelling beans. Grinding them produced more pleasing smells. The first taste after brewing presented a nutty, smooth, full flavor taste. Didn't really detect a Swiss Chocolate flavor, although there were some undertones of another flavor but DEFINITELY NOT Dark Chocolate or Caramel as what was supposed to be in the coffee I ordered. It was VERY good tasting coffee, just not what I ordered. Will I order this again? Probably not, and as much as I would've LOVED to get the Bark at the Moon, I probably won't take a chance trying to order again and hope I get it the next time. Read more | 4.0\nIt smells so good when you grind it  and has a chocolate smell mixed with the smell of really good coffee. And it is really good. It's the kind of coffee that when you start drinking it like you normally would, maybe two or three good sips then set it down for a minute, you keep drinking it instead. before you know it there is none left in the cup. That's pretty much how it happened for me, and yeah it's really good coffee. But it's also 40 dollars which cost it a star. Read more | 5.0\nThe ultimate example of how much I enjoyed Drink Coffee Do Stuff's Bark at the Moon blend was two weeks ago when I had to wake up at 5am to be ready to register my daughter for pre-school next year...the program we are using opens their online registration very early and you want to be first in line to get everything submitted/completed as that can have some impact on if your kid gets into the program. This is usually not a pleasant experience as it entails typing endless pages of contact information, medical details and academic goals...but....I actually looked forward to rolling out of bed because I knew I had a pot of Bark at the Moon ready to go! The bag I got said it was roasted on 2/15 and I received several days after that...so this is some of the freshest coffee I've ever had the pleasure of drinking. I thought that was really cool. I'm a fan of darker blends of coffee and Bark at the Moon certainly fits that category. The description professes it to have notes of dark chocolate, Carmel drizzle and be very rich...I for sure agree with the last two..the dark chocolate doesn't really come out for me that I can notice. I have actually also tried the \"Hell Yeah\" blend from this same company and you can very much taste a difference between the medium-ness of that and the darkness of the Bark at the Moon. The packaging the beans came in seemed high quality and let me rubber band it back up in between grinding beans. I use a Bodum burr grinder and the beans come out really nicely ground up/fine for my drip coffee maker (Technavorm Mochamaster). This morning I have a busy day so I ground up enough for two pots. Pictured are my cats inspecting the bag and my first cup of the morning. Great product! Read more | 5.0\nI think I can taste a bit of the chocolate notes. This coffee is very light, and I'm not a huge fan of dark roast but I'm glad I got dark roast. The beans are not oily at all and smell great. The first thing I noticed was that it was acidic and sour black. So I had it with my usual milk and honey and it just lacked the other notes and depth I'm used to. I do sense the sweetness of the coffee, I think it's not as bitter as I'd imagine dark roast to be. Great mild coffee, good with milk Read more | 4.0",

I don't know what the process is with packaging, it it's because of Amazon's horrible job packing the boxes or if it actually happened at the manufacture's warehouse? I received it in a large 15lb box with 2 other items, the empty space in the box was barely filled. However, I was pleasantly surprised to have zero push back about immediately replacing the damaged product. Within 5 days I received a new case. Still horribly packaged with another item that had been damaged because of that previous order having barely any padding in the box. I was pretty annoyed opening the box to see zero padding in this one with the same fragile item as before. LUCKILY neither product was delivered damaged this time. That aside, in my personal opinion, this tastes great if you don't mind a \"flat\" bitter taste. If you are looking for Espresso, that's exactly what you will get. And the energy source that comes with it. Again, for me personally, it doesn't hit like a hyper energy drink, it wakes me up and gives me a feeling of \"coffee on the go\".

I definitely understand everyone has different taste and likes coffee a certain way. However, not knowing what they(other viewer's) liked or a comparison to what they liked made it difficult to know if I would like these or not. So I'm going to try and explain my preference and if you like what I like then you DEFINITELY won't like these! My normal coffee is Nescafe Clasico/ Dark roast(love that it's frothy, creamy, & doesn't leave that bitter after taste) with Coffee mate Snickers creamer and no sugar because the creamer is enough. I also love Biggby's frozen Butter bear latte w/ extra sweetener and no whip topping. I love my coffee strong but I love the flavors of sweeteners as well. I'm not a black cup of coffee or a 5 teaspoons of sugar person like my two sisters. I guess I'm in the middle. That being said I bought a few different brands to try because my local stores never had my creamer in stock. It would be sold out for weeks and my mornings were just blah without my coffee on the way to work and my first break. We like what we like for our morning regimen lol This does NOT taste like cappuccino! I found this almost tasteless! Really watered down coffee that may have been an extremely light roast, not frothy like some have said, and definitely not creamy either. It was like using one of those k-cups that you fill with your own coffee except you didn't put fresh grounds in it for the third time so it has a faint taste of watered coffee. Which is how my best friend likes her coffee. If you shake some of these (even lightly) you'll get sprayed and it didn't change the taste for me. I really hope this helps someone out.

    "reviews": "SANG with Oatmilk SANG Traditional SANG Straight Black with Vanilla SANG Saigon Cinnamon Latte SANG Saigon Cinnamon Oatmilk Latte I drank one of the cans this morning. It was good and had a good flavor. Good value for the money. It’s keeping me going like I hoped. Good durability. It tasted smooth. The cinnamon flavor was good. Will buy again. I don’t have caffeine jitters after drinking it. Highly recommend! Update: 24 August 2024- I just wanted to say that I drink this coffee and I really love it a lot! It’s keeping me up and going! I will be buying this again. It’s smaller cans compared to other coffees I’ve bought, but it’s just enough. I don’t want a whole lot of coffee to drink. I find other brands are too much for me. I want something to open my eyes, give me energy and keep me going all day without sucking down great big cans or bottles. This is perfect! Read more | 5.0\nI always crave a fresh iced straight black coffee each morning and Every time, it's always too bitter or sour. BUT THIS COFFEE has managed to perfect the recipe to slightly sweeten black coffee just enough to not disrupt the dark flavor!! I pop one in my backpack before school each morning and it keeps me energized throughout classes. So Convenient and Sucha Cute packaging! It also goes well with ANYTHING>> Especially with sweet snacks, and the cold coffee balances out EVERYTHING. PLS keep this COFFEE stocked :)) I'm so excited to try the other flavors!! Read more | 5.0\nIgnoring the false advertising here, the coffee itself tastes pretty good, but in my opinion it's a bit too watery and not creamy like the Vietnamese lattes I've had in local cafes.

I drink one basically every morning if I need to get up earlier or am just generally feeling tired; the caffeine in it is the perfect boost! It is super well-worth the price! Read more | 5.0\nSince it's Vietnamese Coffee, I was expecting the coffee flavor to be more intense, but to me, all I can taste is super super sweet oat milk and cinnamon. I always drink my coffee with creamer so I'm used to slightly sweet coffee, but this is way overboard and makes it undrinkable for me unless I treat it like a creamer for my cold brew coffee. Unfortunately it's not very smooth either...I don't know if it's due to the oat milk or cinnamon, but I physically feel stuff in my throat and develop a cough after I drink it.. Read more | 2.0",

    "reviews": "This 60-count quantity is comprised of 6 of the 10-count boxes, which I like. These smaller boxes fit nicely in my cupboard and make it easy to grab one when needed.

The ease of use is fantastic — pop a pod into the Keurig, press a button, and voila, a delicious, aromatic coffee is ready before you even finish tying your robe. The Pike Place Roast offers that rich, smooth taste that wakes up my senses without overpowering them. The aroma fills the kitchen, and it's like being transported straight to a Starbucks café, minus the queue. What's really impressive is the freshness each pod delivers; it's as if the beans were ground just moments before brewing. I particularly appreciate the value of buying in bulk — having 96 pods means I'm stocked for a good while, and considering the quality and consistency, it's well worth the investment. Plus, knowing that the coffee is ethically sourced adds a morning dose of feel-good to the whole experience. Whether you're a black coffee aficionado or someone who loves experimenting with flavors and add-ins, these pods form a perfect base for your coffee creativity. The smooth taste of Pike Place Roast means it blends seamlessly with whatever extras you throw in, be it syrups, spices, or a splash of cream. All in all, if you're looking for a coffee that brings both quality and comfort to your mornings (or any time of day, really), I can't recommend this product enough.

    "reviews": "Variety Hazelnut, French Vanilla, Caramel, Coffee Sweet, Buttery Overtones of Hazelnut Rich Coffee, Sweet Cream and Buttery Caramel French Vanilla I love this Cappucino! I am a simple, yet persnickety person. I do not typically drink coffee or cappuccino. However, my sister introduced me to French Vanilla cappuccinos years ago, and I have been hooked. This brand is not premium, but it is good and certainly affordable. I do not add anything to it. I run it through my one-cup coffee maker and drink it as is... Some people may add to it. However, I can drink it just fine. Now, please be mindful that I am not an expert. I do not know about different types of cappuccinos or coffee. I am a novice. I am just telling you from that perspective that I like this product. Eat the fish and throw away the bones, people. In other words, take it as it resonates. I am both a novice and a picky person. So, while I am not an expert, I know what I like, and I do not like many things. Yet, I like this. Lol. I hope that helps. Read more | 5.0\nTastes great! I wasn't sure what it would be, but the price was worth trying, and I'm glad I did. It's exactly what I wanted that didn't taste too coffee-like. Perfect for an 8 oz cup. Read more | 5.0\nThis is my go to drink in the morning. I wish the little cups weren't plastic,  but the optional mesh cups for the single serve pods don't work for powders.  The taste is creamy and smooth.  The drink mixes quickly and you can still add flavors or creamers if you prefer.  Buying the cups in bulk is a much better value than the 12 box at the grocery. Read more | 5.0\nI genuinely enjoy this product, so I was a bit annoyed to finally commit to the larger size since I drank it quickly, only for one of my cups to be punctured and empty. On top of missing another one and having 48 (one missing, the other punctured) instead of 50. The coffee itself tastes fantastic and the value for your money is great. Just frustrated to be missing two cups. Read more | 4.0\nGreat French vanilla flavor… I drink it everyday Read more | 5.0\nThis cappuccino tastes AMAZING! Just like the French Vanilla coffee that you get from the coffee machines at gas stations :) Whenever I have someone over at my house for the first time, I always ask them if they would like to try it. Once they try it the first time, every time they visit me again, they always want some more! I have not found a person that does not like this coffee! It is that yummy! I decided to buy it because I realized I was sort of addicted to the French Vanilla coffees at the gas station by my house. I would seriously buy 2-3 cappuccinos at this gas station every single day of the week. I started adding up the numbers and saw that I was spending way too much money on coffee, so I came to Amazon to see if I could find something just like it, but for cheaper. After reading a bunch of reviews for these k-cups, I saw that a lot of customers were recommending it and kept saying \"it tasted just like gas station French Vanilla\" so those words convinced me to buy it! Here are some of my suggestions: I personally feel that when brewed in amounts of 8 oz or more, it tastes \"watered down\". I like to do 4oz or 6 oz and it tastes just perfect for me (even though the manufacturer recommends up to 8 oz)! I always run hot water through my Keurig after making these (as suggested by the manufacturer) to make sure that nothing is left behind after brewing. I like to top it off with a bit of whipped cream. The hot coffee melts the whipped cream almost instantly and the whipped cream makes it taste so much better, however, adding whipped cream is not necessary. When I run out of whipped cream from time to time, I still drink it without it and love it as well. Finally, as other reviewers said, this is not the healthiest drink to have. It contains a lot of artificial flavors and other ingredients that are not good for you, so if you are super health conscious, then this is probably not for you. If you care about your health, but do like to treat yourself to something sweet every now and then (or daily, like me) then get this!! I drink this daily, at least once a day, but sometimes have up to 3 (mornings, afternoons, and some evenings) and it tastes great at any time of the day :) ***I paid full price for this item and my review is 100% my opinion.

As someone who is always on the go, these shakes have become a staple in my routine, providing me with the **protein** and **nutrients** I need in a convenient, ready-to-drink format. Let’s talk about the **flavor**—this vanilla shake is rich, smooth, and surprisingly delicious! It’s not overly sweet, which I appreciate, and it has a clean, organic taste that doesn’t leave any aftertaste like some other protein shakes do. It’s just the right balance of creamy and flavorful. I’ve enjoyed having it both as a quick breakfast and as an afternoon snack, and it satisfies my cravings without feeling too heavy. In terms of **nutrition**, this shake is a powerhouse. It packs **16g of organic plant-based protein** per serving, which is great for muscle recovery or just keeping me full between meals. The fact that it’s made with **organic ingredients** is a huge selling point for me, as I try to avoid artificial additives in my diet. Plus, it provides **27 vitamins and minerals**, which is great for ensuring I get a balanced dose of essential nutrients throughout the day. Whether I’m on a busy workday or out running errands, this shake keeps me feeling energized and nourished. Another thing I love is that this is a **meal replacement drink**—it’s not just a quick snack, but a full meal substitute. It’s filling enough to keep me satisfied for hours, and I don’t feel sluggish or bloated after drinking it, unlike some other protein shakes I’ve tried. I’ve also noticed that it’s gentle on my stomach, which is a bonus since some protein shakes can cause discomfort. The **11 oz bottle** size is perfect for an on-the-go lifestyle. I can easily grab one from the fridge, throw it in my bag, and I’ve got a **healthy meal replacement** ready whenever I need it. Plus, the fact that it comes in a pack of **12** makes it convenient for weekly use.

    "reviews": "Chocolate Medley Salt Chocolate Caramel Salt Chocolate Salt I suffer from issues with staying hydrated due to having a large part of my colon removed several years ago and now not being able to absorb water causing issues with fatigue and excruciating leg cramps throughout the day. I have been drinking LMNT after it was recommended to me earlier in the year and I can't go without it anymore. This drink in particular is what I look forward to every morning and although it doesn't give you the exact energy as coffee does, I DEFINITELY felt a lack of energy without it and without the jitters that coffee gives you. I did go a few days without it earlier in the week due to price and not being able to buy it as soon as I ran out of my last box and I started to feel extremely tired, crampy, thirsty and issues with constipation. Let me tell you, I came up with the money ASAP to re-purchase it because I can no longer go without it. I definitely love the chocolate salt flavor mixed in with hot water alone. At first the taste of salt was so strong, but now I crave more salt. LOL. I find myself drinking 1 to 2 packs a day depending on my activity throughout the day and lack of water intake throughout the day. I'm a true believer and I love this stuff.

Look no further...and because it works so well, and tastes so amazing without a bunch of junk, I don't want to hear it about the price, mmmkay? Because if something does what it says it is going to do - and this does: it says it will healthfully hydrate you, while beating cravings with deliciousness and without garbage that can throw you into cravings the next day. Spoiler alert - it does all of this...the only downside I found is it can make you a bit gassy, so, whether it is homeopathic or western medicine, I suggest taking a tooter-totaler. My suggestion, if you'd like it...and if you keep reading, you do, so enjoy!: For hot chocolate, only use half a pack in a large mug with 85% water, and 15% heavy cream (added at the end). You heat your water, add half the pack, stir until it is completely mixed and then add in about a quarter cup of heart whipping cream....it.is.insanely tasty! The whole pack makes it more flavor rich but very salty - this recipe truly puts a good old fashion cup of Swissmiss in your hand, with a delightful dash of saltiness. For the cold fab, ala Serendipity New York: Mix a full pack into a tall glass of water, stir,stir,stir and then add in the 1/4 cup of heavy whipping cream, top with ice and a decorative swirl straw....the straw is very important, honestly: make sure what you're eating us fun to look at if you're bored with your diet....it's the fun stuff that lured you into eating the junk, and so let your new healthy choices have some decoration too! You might think it'll make you crazy sprinkles or something of the like, but it doesn't - corny as it sounds, it makes you feel cherished, happy and celebrated...even if it's just you, the dog and YouTube. Happy hydrating and prayers anyone reading this is truly blessed in the name of Jesus in their every need and effort. We're doing these diets for a reason and I pray whatever your need is, it is met. Amen. Read more | 5.0\nI bought and compared four different electrolyte powders.  They were Ultima Replenisher Grape, Keppi Keto Lemon Lime Splash, Key Nutrients Recovery Plus and LMNT Key Hot Chocolate. My goals were - not too much salt (that I can add cheaply to my diet), enough potassium (I suffer the dreaded Keto Calf Cramps in a hard swimming work out), dissolve well and stay dissolved, and taste okay.  Stretch goal: Individual affordable packets, because I travel a LOT. My test included aerating for 30 seconds the powder in 500ml (I know they want more, but seriously, who drinks a half-litre first thing in the morning) and the letting it sit for a minute (because, cats and S.O. dontchaknow.)  LMNT \"Hot Chocolate\" took the most blending; the cocoa doesn't go easy.  (It was cold water.)  But it did blend. The second photo is precipitate after a minute.  LMNT did 2nd worst, but I blame the cocoa.  Hotter water might have solved that. But this is salty.  Very salty.  It's not yucky, but it is salty.  The inside of their box has one side dedicated to \"Stay Salty\" and the bottom printed with, \"It looks like you need more salt.\" Oddly, salt isn't my main need.  Potassium is.  I can add salt to my food trivially, and have on hand multiple gourmet salts in a cellar at the table.  (For the curious, currently Maldon Smoked Sea Salt flakes, Saltverk Seaweed Sea Salt and Coarse Pink Himalayan Salt.) It's also expensive considering.  I think the Key Nutrients is preferable, because I don't need the salt.  But if you really need salt, and can't find a source at, I don't know, perhaps the grocery store, this stuff is great.

This one is my favorite if I am going to be very sweaty - after a run and sauna for example.  I actually love the salty chocolate flavor.  I mix it with at least 36oz of water so it's not super salty.  I couldn't imagine mixing it with just 8 or even 16! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n1.0\n5.0",

Will defenitaly be purchasing again might monthly subscribe it’s just that good. Read more | 5.0\nI'm surprised by how much I like this! I tried it at a local coffee shop, and have enjoyed it since. I don't think it tastes exactly like mocha, but it is similar. I add it to my coffee in the morning and I find it makes difference to start the morning without a jolt of sugar - it tastes sweet enough without making me crave sweets all day, the way sugar can. I think it had helped my focus. It really does help with bloating and digestion too, which I didn't think we're issues for me but I see a clear difference when I skip this. Nice way to get some additional supplements. Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nWhat an amazing product this is! I was skeptical at first but after a week of 1 scoop in my coffee every morning, I will never go back. It has helped me with my inconsistent gut issues, I have sustained energy throughout the day and my mind always feel so sharp. It is honestly a miracle supplement. Read more | 5.0\nSomewhere along the way in my children, I learned to hate mushrooms with a purple passion.  I would rather eat week-old roadkill than a nasty old shroom.  One of my kids' friends brought over a bag of Chagoccino and a cuppa was made for me that had my normal morning latte with the added Chagaccino scoop thrown in.  First of all, the flavor was wonderful.  It had a rich, earthly flavor that added a lovely layer of yum to my coffee.  Secondly, I loved the bit of sweetness the powder added to my coffee and was thrilled to find that it was the calorie-free monkfruit.  And lastly, I found myself to be better able to remember my Spanish vocabulary during my studies!  My mood is stable through the ups and downs of my days as well, which are full and have many stressors.  My husband was up all night working (he's an IT guy with a big brain and there was a huge network problem) and never slept and is working all day.  I gave him some Chagacinno and he's as perky as a 2 year old after eating Skittles.  Thank you for this great product!  The inserts you sent with the bag that explained the quality of your product and the meticulous production methods you use will keep me a customer for life! Read more | 5.0\nI first had a Chagaccino is our local coffee shop here in Naples Florida. I was like what on wart was this. Once I tasted it I was hooked. And all of the pure natural ingredients and health benefits is amazing to me. I started off with the 10 individual packages, which then went to the tin container. Which now I buy the refills and fill it in my tin container. One of the times I ordered I got that cute little mushroom metal scooper, which is adorable. I couldn’t recommend this product anymore. It’s just absolutely delicious and perfect for your health. Read more | 5.0\nI love this product! It makes my espresso drinks taste even more amazing and adds an wxtra boost of antioxidants and brain function. Coffee shops cost at least $10 for one drink containing this product so this is very cost-effective if you buy online and make it yourself. :) Read more | 5.0\nI love the taste and health benefits of this product. I mix it with either brewed coffee, or Nespresso (it mixes well either using a handheld electric tool, or by hand with a spoon). It has monk fruit which adds just a subtle extra sweetness. I feel like this product really helps wake up my brain, and gives a little extra boost for my day. I also like how this product comes in pre-measured packets, which helps save time, and great for travel or on-the-go convenience. I have 4 stars as the product is a little pricey,  it other than that it is great. Read more | 4.0\nOnce you try a chagaccino you’ll be hooked.

What may taste good too me might not taste good to another. I like my coffee with cream and sweetener. The first brew through with Stunptown Hairbender I was underwhelmed. The coffee barely covered the taste of the creamer. I was pretty disappointed. The next day o brewed it stronger and that changed the whole thing.  It was really good and a joyful change of pace.  For me it's very earthy meaning it tasted a little pine desert sage after a rain. What I realized is it doesn't have the bite of the bitter burnt mass produced coffees.  I'll buy again.

    "reviews": "Tropical Taste Pack Fruity Flavors Bundle White Peach Variety Pack Tropical Punch Super Berry Strawberry Watermelon Remix Variety Pack Pineapple Coconut Mango Splash Green Apple Frosted Grape Cherry Limeade Dwanta's Holiday Punch Wild Orange Alright, let’s talk energy drinks. I’ve tried a bunch of them, and Zoa energy drinks are definitely up there with the best. They’re packed with good stuff like vitamins, electrolytes, and amino acids, and they give me a solid energy boost without making me feel jittery. Plus, the flavors are pretty awesome – I mean, who doesn’t love a good Tropical Punch or Pineapple Coconut? But here’s the thing – as much as I love Zoa for a midday pick-me-up, I still start my mornings with Yerba Magic. There’s just something about it that sets the tone for the day. Yerba Magic is this fantastic instant yerba mate drink that’s super easy to make. Just mix a scoop with water, and you’re good to go. No steeping, no fuss – perfect for my groggy, half-asleep self in the morning. Yerba Magic has this refreshing peach mango flavor that’s a nice wake-up call. It’s packed with prebiotics and probiotics, so my gut feels great, and the energy boost is smooth and steady. I don’t get those annoying jitters or crashes, which is a huge win. It’s like all the benefits of traditional yerba mate without the hassle of brewing it. I usually get mine in less than two days when I order it off Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5YVMX9Q Yerba Magic is loaded with prebiotics and probiotics, which are key players in maintaining a healthy digestive system. The prebiotics, like chicory inulin and apple fiber, help nourish the good bacteria in your gut, making them more effective. This, in turn, supports better digestion and overall gut health. Since I started drinking Yerba Magic, I’ve noticed a significant reduction in bloating and digestive discomfort. So, my routine goes like this: I kick off the day with Yerba Magic to get my head straight and my energy flowing. Then, if I need an extra boost later in the day, I grab a Zoa. It’s the perfect combo – Yerba Magic keeps me focused and balanced in the morning, and Zoa gives me that extra push when I need it, especially during those afternoon slumps. In short, Zoa energy drinks are fantastic, but Yerba Magic is my go-to for starting the day right. If you’re looking for a great way to boost your mornings and stay energized throughout the day, give this combo a try. You won’t be disappointed! Read more | 5.0\nNew favorite energy drink! All of the flavors were good, although, not a huge fan of the watermelon. Has about 160mg of caffeine vs other drinks with 200. Caffeine comes from green tea and green coffee beans. Has multiple vitamins and electrolytes. I wish I could find them in bulk at stores! Read more | 5.0\nI was a hardcore Celcius fan and prior to that a Red Bull fan. But wanted to give ZOA a try. I first tried the Tropical Punch flavor and right away, love it! It doesn't have the weird \"fake sugar\" taste that usually gives me a headache. It's crisp and honestly tastes like a light, fresh, less sweet Hawaiian Punch with a little fizz. And NO JITTERS! It's a clean, smooth energy that doesn't feel unnatural. I love that it comes in a 16-ounce option. My only complaint is the price because it can be pricey at times but it does seem to fluctuate. Cherry flavor is good as well.

But, it's great just the same! I live the variety, the not overbearing sweetness. I like to share new products with my co workers which is what I did when these arrived. I do believe we will all be ordering these in the future. Green 🍏 apple is good. Pineapple Coconut 🍍🥥is good. Not a huge fan of anything peach flavored. But the white peach 🍑is good too. Next on the list is Orange 🍊 , and I am looking forward to that! Read more | 5.0\nNot much on sports drinks but I do like the Zoe flavor original taste with low calories and green tea pick me up. However, I have been trying to buy more orders through Amazone and have had little to no success.  I hope the I can see this product in local Wal-Mart, Cosco, or GMC in the northeast parts of Texas. This product I definitely would like to continue to purchase. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the ZOA Zero Sugar Energy Drinks in the variety pack, and while my stepdad absolutely loves them, I have mixed feelings. They’re sugar-free and packed with electrolytes, vitamin C, amino acids, and B-vitamins, which is great for a healthy boost. However, I did notice a funny aftertaste that reminded me of burnt hair, which wasn’t very pleasant for me. If you're looking for a healthier energy drink option, they might work for you, especially if you enjoy unique flavors! Read more | 3.0\nGreat flavor, it doesn’t take like it’s sugar free!

    "reviews": "You know, like many people I haven't always been a fan of Starbucks coffee (leaving aside the current controversies around unionizing there, and arguments over money, as usual). A long time ago it was baffling to see the popularity of the brand and its stores, because everybody knew their coffee was awful. \"Burnt\", said everyone, correctly. They took care of that quite a while back, and now their coffee is legitimately wonderful-- as good as any, I'd say, or near enough. Here's a pound-and-a-half of Starbucks house blend for $10. Wow. And it is really, really delicious coffee. I can attest to it, since I'm just a little bit of a coffee afficionado. What it says about the coffee on the coffee bag is actually exactly what's true about the coffee in the bag, if you can believe it. It has a wonderful complexity with hints of exotic flavors, and, overall, it's just a very pleasant coffee for every day. I love medium roasts because they never offend and always please, if they're a good blend and roast. I'm very happy to have run across Starbucks coffee here! I've been buying it over and over again! Drinking this very fine, even gourmet coffee, and I'm not even spending tons of money. Yaay!

    "reviews": "This is one of the best coffee alternatives I’ve tried, and I’m giving it a solid 5 out of 5. While it has significantly less caffeine than a regular cup of coffee, it truly stands out compared to other adaptogenic morning drinks. Many alternatives tend to taste unpleasant or don’t mix well, but this product excels in both areas. The flavor is enjoyable—not exactly like coffee, but it caters well to those looking for a satisfying substitute. It mixes seamlessly with hot water, and you can easily add creamer if desired. The functional benefits from ingredients like lion’s mane and other adaptogens are another huge plus, making it a great addition to a morning routine. My only minor complaint is the container size—it feels a bit small for the price, and I wish there was an option to purchase a larger quantity. Overall, though, this product is worth it for the taste, quality, and health benefits! Read more | 5.0\nI admit to being hesitant but I LOVE this brand.  I still have one cappucino in the morning but then is my second cup of goodness.  I mix with warm, frothed milk and honey and it's perfect to get me through the morning.  They also have a matcha in small packets that are great for travel or a mid-day break.  I'm a subscriber! Read more | 5.0\nThis mushroom coffee had a chi tea taste which was okay but when a after finishing a cup the sediment in the bottom of the cup was horrible. The other difficulty is after using this product for 3 weeks I became extremely ill, it got to the point that I went to the hospital. COVID TEST NEGATIVE, BLOOD WORK NEGATIVE, gastric enzymes where off the chart. The doctor explained that I had a lower intestinal infection and since the only new thing added to my diet was MUD WATER the doctor attributed it to the sediment that could not be properly digested. I advise if you have any digestive issues DO NOT USE THIS PRODUCT. Read more | 1.0\nMUD*WTR Mushroom Coffee Review - A Mixed Experience As most reviewers have mentioned, the taste of MUD*WTR is definitely an acquired one. I wasn’t thrilled at first, but over time, I actually got used to it. I sweeten mine with honey and add oat milk, which helps create a fairly tasty beverage that I can enjoy in the morning. In terms of mental clarity, I personally haven’t noticed a significant difference. However, the biggest benefit for me has been the energy boost. Unlike regular coffee, MUD*WTR gives me a nice lift without that jittery feeling, which is great for my body. I decided to try this because I have a stomach ulcer, and I was pleasantly surprised that it didn’t upset my stomach at all. That being said, I’m not sure I’ll be repurchasing. The price is pretty steep for what you get, and I’m not sure the benefits outweigh the cost for me personally. Still, if you’re looking for a smoother alternative to coffee that doesn’t irritate your stomach, this might be worth a try. Read more | 4.0\nI haven't even tried the product yet, but the difficulty getting the lid off was punctuated with unskillful language. The lid and the body of the very visually attractive metal container were closed with a little piece of sticker tape, and that came off easily, but then when you try to turn or pull the lid off, you will have no help from anything resembling thoughtful design. The lid and the body of the metal container are unthreaded and tight, and do not like turning against each other. They're supposed to just easily pull apart I suppose. There was nothing easy about it, and unless this concoction is clearly superior to the others that I've tried recently, it will earn none of my dollars just because of that design flaw. Products are like people; first impressions persist. If this is not a problem for anybody else, then that's great, but if you get even one more complaint similar to mine, your product needs some packaging help.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Bundle C4 Smart Energy Official Variety Pack Watermelon Burst Tropical Passion-fruit Tropical Oasis Variety Pack Strawberry Guava Peach Mango Nectar Cherry Berry Lime Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Yuzu Black Cherry C4 Brain & Body Official Variety Pack Berry Breeze Variety Pack The media could not be loaded. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost. I still prefer Rockstar or Monster overall. Read more | 4.0\nCellucor is the best energy drink on the market.  The flavors are great, and just the right amount of energy.  I love the Variety pack, and the cost is reasonable compared to others Read more | 5.0\nGreat for energy, great taste no flat taste & easy for use, came sooner than expected Read more | 5.0\nExcellent product! Love the taste and energy and mental clarity these give me! Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the C4 Smart Energy Drink in Watermelon Burst flavor, and I am thoroughly impressed. Here's why I highly recommend this product: Zero Sugar: As someone conscious of sugar intake, I appreciate that this energy drink is sugar-free. It provides a clean energy boost without the guilt or crash associated with sugary beverages. Natural Energy: C4 Smart Energy Drink harnesses natural energy sources and nootropics to provide a sustained boost in focus and energy. I felt alert and productive without the jittery feeling often associated with other energy drinks. Refreshing Flavor: The Watermelon Burst flavor is incredibly refreshing and enjoyable. It's not too overpowering, with just the right amount of sweetness to satisfy my taste buds. Convenient Packaging: The 12oz cans are convenient for on-the-go consumption. Whether I'm heading to the gym or need a pick-me-up during a busy workday, I can easily grab a can and enjoy a burst of energy whenever I need it. Effective Ingredients: With 200mg of caffeine and nootropics, this energy drink delivers a noticeable increase in focus and productivity. It's perfect for those moments when I need to power through tasks or workouts. No Crash: One of the best features of this energy drink is that it provides a smooth and gradual energy boost without the dreaded crash afterward. I felt energized for hours without experiencing any sudden drop in energy levels. Final Thoughts: The C4 Smart Energy Drink is a game-changer for anyone looking to boost focus and energy without compromising on ingredients or experiencing a crash later on. With its delicious flavor, effective ingredients, and convenient packaging, it's become my go-to choice for a clean energy boost. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n1.0\n2.0\n5.0\n1.0",

Read more | 5.0\nI started ordering Original Donut Shop coffee several months ago. Originally we ordered the dark roast, but it was a little too strong, (and I love strong coffee), so we switched to the regular roast, which is perfect. It's not bitter, it's smooth and delicious. The aroma fills my house while it's brewing and wakes me up if my husband is making coffee before me. The price point is great, too. Some might think it's expensive, but the store brand of 12 k-cups at my local supermarket is $7, so $16 for 32 k-cups isn't overly expensive in my opinion. Personally speaking, this coffee is worth every dime. My morning coffee is very important to me, so I'd happily pay a little more for it to be enjoyable. And Original Donut Shop coffee is enjoyable. I'm a happy, devoted customer. As long as this coffee continues to taste delicious, it will be part of my morning routine. Definitely recommend. Read more | 5.0\nGreat flavor and value.

We threw it in the cabinet and didn't really think about it again. The first time I drank it, it was decent. Absolutely no bitterness. At all. I almost missed a little bite. Went back to our old coffee ($20/lb from Whole Foods) and didn't really think about it again. So...

And he told me my \"most perfect cup\" was indeed the Amazon coffee. Maybe it was the blind taste test, maybe it was thinking it was the far more expensive coffee—confirmation bias is powerful. But I have to say I look forward to this coffee every morning and every night. It doesn't give me caffeine jitters. It doesn't give me acid reflux. It's nice and smooth. It doesn't take much sweetener at all so be careful with your sweetener of choice. And... it's a good price. A rarity these days. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered this with some trepidation, considering that the price was absurdly low for quality coffee. I was shocked to find that it's actually quite good, with a similar taste profile to the Brazilian that I buy from a local supplier, specifically no bitterness and a wonderful smoothness but at a slightly higher price. Did I mention that it's also inexpensive? Read more | 5.0\nHonestly good inexpensive ground coffee. Unfortunately the packaging is terrible. Vast majority of bags tear resulting in spillage or a mess. Trimming is only reliable option but degrades coffee as doesn’t seal as well for storage. Would give 5 stars if they’d fix the bags. Read more | 4.0\nI read my past coffee reviews and all I can say is that I was either trying too hard or I was a pretentious donkey-hole. Let's go with the donkey version. Moving on: this is really good coffee. That's the tl;dr I usually prefer dark roast coffees for the dark chocolate and sweet caramel-ish flavors of the roasts. But this medium roast has the dark cocoa and sweet flavors I love, not as strongly of course, but with the smoothness you expect from a medium roast. That's also what the other coffee drinker in our house says. She naturally leans towards medium roasts but will drink whatever is in the pot without complaint or question (my kind of human!). My last thought about this coffee: the aroma .  .  . mmmmmm. It's been a long time since any brand or roast has filled our house with the smell of coffee brewing.  This one does it consistently. I'm halfway through the second bag and it's still doing it. Dang that's a good smell. Yeah, yeah, I hear it in my head too! Don't you wish we came up with that jingle? Read more | 5.0\nI have no complaints about this coffee, it's very good for the price. It's mild and not at all bitter, with a nutty, dark chocolate finish. Read more | 5.0\nJust an ok average arabica bean blended light roast. No flavor notes stand out but it does drink easily and smooth. Not the most flavorful but it's still much better than your average big name brand coffee. Read more | 3.0\nI normally prefer a light roasted  (morning blend) coffee like Maxwell House. With coffee prices increasing, I have been looking for coffee deals.  This one popped up with a special pricing .It is a full flavored coffee that smells wonderful brewing. It brews a delicious cup of coffee. Read more | 5.0\nHad a few cups of this coffee and it always left me feeling like I \"almost\" had a good cup of coffee. It's not bitter, very smooth but just not enough flavor, and though not bad, it's on the weak side for me. Even it's color is light. I think this should be more a light roast than a medium.

Whether you’re starting your day or savoring a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, this coffee is the perfect companion. Rating: 6/5 – Tim Hortons Has Raised the Bar Yet Again! Read more | 5.0\nTim Horton's 100% Arabica Dark Roast is a coffee with very good reviews. If we are to believe them, it has gained popularity due to its rich flavor and high quality. It is packaged in a bright red bag that is very thick and not easy to open. On one hand, I would like to say that the bright red bag stands out among other coffee brands, but this is probably the fourth or fifth coffee in red packaging that I’ve encountered recently. I don’t drink coffee myself, so I primarily want to share the impressions of the beverage that my family has shared with me. Probably the most typical situation for this coffee is morning awakening. The drink is very rich and full-bodied, with a light chocolate note that pleasantly envelops the flavor. But perhaps the most important thing is that despite the dark roast, this coffee is not bitter, making it an ideal candidate for breakfast – if, of course, you drink coffee. There is an opinion that this product pairs well with milk, further enhancing its flavor. Personally, I would like to highlight the aroma emanating from the coffee; it is simply delightful! However, like any other product, Tim Horton's 100% Arabica Dark Roast has its nuances. First and foremost, it should be noted that for quite a number of people, this coffee may turn out to be too strong, so don’t overdo it. In conclusion, Tim Horton's 100% Arabica Dark Roast is a coffee that is perfect for lovers of very strong, rich, and aromatic drinks. The price is quite reasonable for the quality. Read more | 5.0\nThis medium roast coffee is a classic, delivering a smooth, balanced flavor with no bitterness. Made from 100% Arabica beans, it has a rich aroma and a satisfying depth that’s perfect for both black coffee lovers and those who enjoy it with cream and sugar. It brews well in standard coffee makers and is a great everyday coffee for those who want a reliable, smooth cup. Pros: ✔ Smooth, well-balanced flavor ✔ No bitter aftertaste ✔ Great for everyday drinking Cons: ✖ Might be too mild for those who prefer a stronger brew Read more | 5.0\nThe Tim Hortons brand's \"Original Blend Medium Roast Ground Coffee\" is made from 100% premium Arabica beans, this coffee had a balanced flavor profile -- not too dark, not too light, and not too acidic, Its medium roast delivers smoothness and consistency, making it ideal for daily consumption. It comes in a sealed laminated pouch for longer freshness.  The pouch can be reclosed, but not resealed.  It is generally easy to unseal on first open for those with good hand strength, grip, and dexterity. The coffee is rather finely ground, so it's not the optimal choice for a French press. Being finely ground, I use less of the coffee to achieve the same strength, so there is that. Pros: Smooth, balanced medium roast flavor. Crafted from 100 percent Arabica beans. Cons: Some may find the medium roast too mild for stronger taste preferences. Slightly pricier than other ground coffee brands in the same category. Read more | 5.0\nGood but not as great as I thought it would be. I’ve read a lot of hype about this brand of coffee but honestly, I still don’t know what the hype is all about. I figured I would try it because I hadn’t tried it since I was out of state at an actual drive up. The value for the money is good. The aroma is great. The taste is OK.

    "reviews": "Vegan Variety Variety Vegan Vanilla Caramel Vegan Chocolate Vanilla Strawberry Salted Caramel Pina Colada Mint Chocolate Cookies & Cream Chocolate Peanut Butter Chocolate Banana Café Mocha This is hands down one of the best protein shakes I’ve tried! The chocolate flavor is rich and smooth, without that chalky aftertaste that many other shakes have. With 40g of protein and zero sugar, it keeps me full and energized for hours—perfect for a post-workout recovery or a meal replacement on busy days. I also love that it’s gluten-free and packed with 22 vitamins and minerals. It’s convenient, doesn’t require refrigeration until opened, and has a great texture (not too thick or watery). If you’re looking for a high-protein, low-carb shake that actually tastes good, this is the one to get! Read more | 5.0\nThese RTD protein shakes are top notch. There isn't any chalky after taste and they go down smooth. I use these daily after workouts to help fill in my protein needs. It feels like your holding gold every time you drink one, due to there being 40g of protein per shake. They are convenient and worth every penny spent. Read more | 5.0\nCreamy, 40 grams of protein, 0 sugar…say no more. Ready to drink shakes are an essential in my book but I’ve had a hard time finding brands that don’t taste horrible or have macros that are awful - in comes Lean Body as a solution. I had such a hard time selecting my first flavor to try but I’m thrilled with the chocolate peanut butter (I can’t wait to try others). It’s sweet but not overly so, creamy (not chalky), and suffices the craving of having something sweet. If you’ve had Premier Protein’s PB cup it’s similar to those but maybe a tad less sweet/artificial tasting. Oh! It also heats well which I was pleasantly surprised by. Sometimes I just ~have~ to start my morning with something warm but can’t always stomach coffee so this legit turns into hot chocolate. I’m a “hungry” person SOS but these shakes do a great job of keeping me full. They’re BIG so while the price might seem a little high I promise you it’s not. A shake could easily be split in two if necessary which would stretch the budget even further. I would’ve really liked to see something like stevia as the sweeteners but beggars can’t be choosers. Very well done. Read more | 5.0\nThis has to be the best tasting protein on the market! I really love the strawberry flavor! I am really picky when it comes to strawberry protein, but this flavor is the best! I love that I can literally replace breakfast with one of these. These protein shakes are a bit pricier, but worth it because you are replacing a whole meal for one. I also love the fact that they are 40 grams of protein per shake. Read more | 5.0\nNutrition is really solid. Felt like I was having an actual meal when I finished. Flavor was more chocolatey than anything. Was really hoping for that peanut butter chocolate combo that I like.  Overall pretty good. Read more | 4.0\nI went through a whole case of these shakes, and I have to say, I’m really impressed. The vanilla flavor is surprisingly good—smooth, not too sweet, and without that weird aftertaste a lot of sugar-free drinks have. It actually tastes like vanilla, which is harder to get right than you’d think. I have a desk job, and it’s way too easy to fall into the habit of grabbing fast food for lunch. Keeping a couple of these at work made a huge difference. They kept me full and made it a lot easier to stay on track without feeling like I was missing out. Over the time I was drinking them, I even dropped a couple of pounds, which was a nice bonus. If you’re looking for something convenient, filling, and actually enjoyable to drink, I’d definitely recommend giving these a try. I’ll be ordering more for sure. Read more | 5.0\nOne of the highest proteins per drink I’ve seen in a ready to drink carton of this size. Lots of flavors to choose from and shelf stable for over a year. Good drink for on the go protein and tastes great! Read more | 5.0\nI was surprised by how good the Lean Body Banana 40g Protein Shake tastes! The banana flavor is smooth and natural, not overly artificial or too sweet like some other protein shakes. The texture is thick and creamy, making it feel more like a real milkshake than a typical watery protein drink. I actually enjoy thick consistencies in comparison to watered down shakes, so this was a huge plus for me. It also makes me feel full for a longer time when I compare it to other protein shakes I’ve drank in the past. I’d buy it again! Read more | 5.0\n1.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0",

The 28-count pack is perfect for households or offices, ensuring there’s plenty to go around. The cocoa itself has a rich and creamy texture when brewed, and the milk chocolate flavor is comforting and satisfying. It’s an easy treat for both kids and adults, and the Keurig compatibility makes preparation effortless—just pop a pod in, press a button, and enjoy. However, the taste of the sweetener in the mix is a bit of a letdown. It has an artificial aftertaste that detracts from the overall flavor. While it’s not overly offensive, it’s noticeable enough to keep this from being the perfect hot cocoa experience. Adding a splash of milk or a dollop of whipped cream helps balance the taste and elevate the flavor. The pods arrived well-packaged and undamaged, and the brewing process was consistent across multiple cups. For the convenience and comfort it provides, this is still a great product, but a better choice of sweetener would make it truly exceptional.

    "reviews": "64 Ounces 84.5 Ounces 102 Ounces I've only had this dispenser for a couple of weeks, but so far it seems very good.  I use it to keep the coffee that I brew in the morning warm all day.  It does a pretty good job.  It does not have the thermal qualities of a Yeti, but it's better than the other thermal dispensers and carafes that I have tried. To help it keep the coffee warmer longer, it helps to fill it with hot water and then empty it before adding the hot coffee.  I usually buy a similar dispenser from Walmart for about half the price, but the plastic pump part in the lid cracks within a year or two and then I'd have to buy another.  This one has better pumping action than the Walmart one, but doesn't keep the coffee as hot. The Walmart has a glass inside and this one is steel.  That being said, I still like it better the other ones I've tried.  I hope the pump will last.  If it is still going strong after a couple of years, I'll update my review. So far I would recommend it and don't think anyone would be disappointed with this product. Update 1-24-18 Mine is still working well.  I noticed that the advertising says it will keep liquid hot 24 hours.  I'm wondering if this is a new improved version because my carafe only keeps my coffee hot about 4 hours.  I make coffee at about 7:30 am and by noon it is only luke warm.  If they did improve it with insulation similar the Yeti products, I would be willing to buy the new version.  If anyone knows the answer to this, please post. If they did not improve it with better insulation, I would say the claim to keep liquids hot for 24 hours would be false advertising. Update 6-21-18 After using this daily (about a year and 3 months) for our morning coffee, the pump started to get weak.  It would take about 12 pumps or more to fill a coffee cup. I replaced it with the same model and now it only takes 2 pumps to fill a coffee cup.  I noticed the instructions state to fill it with hot water first before using it to keep your coffee hot for as long as possible. Update 7-15-18 I am happy to say that they have improved the thermal qualities with this new model.  After pouring hot coffee into this new model, the outside remains cool.  On the old model the outside would be warm after filling putting hot liquid in it.  My coffee now stays warm throughout the day.  I would definitely recommend this product now. Update 9-5-19 After using this new improve version for a little over a year, it stopped keeping the hot coffee warm.  When I fill it with hot coffee at about 7 am, by about 10:30 am the coffee is only luke warm.  Also I always fill it with hot water first while the coffee is being brewed so that the inside of the airpot is already warm.  The only thing I can think of for it to lose it thermal qualities, is that somehow the inside seal got broken.  Anyways, I liked the way it worked up until now, so I decided to buy a new one in hopes that it will work the way this one did for the first year.  Just a little disappointed that it didn't last longer. Update 6-1-20 The carafe I bought on 9-5-19 would keep the coffee hot all day until about 5 pm, but even then it would still be warm.  On 5-11-20 it stopped keeping the coffee hot.  By about 2 pm, it is already cold.  This is the 3rd one that I have bought and they all have the same problem. They work great at keeping the coffee hot all day for several months and then all of a sudden the coffee is only luke warm by noon.  What happens to these coffee pots that cause them to lose their thermal qualities? I emailed my concerns to the vendor and they immediately responded that they thought I had a lemon and sent me a replacement.  The replacement works great, but I wonder for how long. The two previous ones on bought kept their thermal qualities for between 9 - 15 months and then lost it.  I am very impressed with the customer service for this product and would recommend it.  I just can't understand how it can lose its ability to keep liquids hot after being used for a period of time.  Should you have a similar problem, don't hesitate to reach out to their customer service.  They were super with me. Read more | 5.0\nThis a gem product for family gathering.

Read more | 4.0\nUpdate 9-5-17: FOR THOSE UNFAMILIAR WITH THE \"THERMOS\" BOTTLES OF ANOTHER ERA ... I have been reading several reviews that say the airpot does not keep hot things hot. Unless you have a defective pot or did not close it properly, IT ONLY REQUIRES ONE THING TO KEEP STEAMING HOT CONTENTS steaming hot  for 12+ hours.  PREHEAT the metal mass of this LARGE METAL HEAT SINK with hot water before filling with coffee, soup, etc.! A room temperature airpot when filled will pull heat from the contents until it reaches an equilibrium temperature\" that will slowly cool down as the outside metal surface releases heat to the surrounding air. The COLDER the ambient temperature, the faster the contents will cool down. In cold temp environments, it might pay to cover (insulate) with a towel or blanket. Two weeks ago: Just bought this Thermal Coffee Airpot to be able to provide HOT coffee to a small group without having to transport a coffee maker to each weekly gathering... this holds about 12 8-oz foam coffee cup servings which should be enough along with other beverage offerings and water. So the BIG QUESTION IS... will this keep coffee hot for 24 hours as it states in the literature. Only one way to find out... filled the airpot (preheated with hot tap water) 2/3 full of boiling hot water and sealed it up. TWELVE hours later, pumped out a cup & observed STEAM still coming off the poured cup! Twenty-four hours later, pumped out a cup & observed no steam... but stuck my finger in the cup, and it was still HOT enough to be drinkable coffee & not be called \"lukewarm!\" Maybe lukewarm will be at 36 hours (the maximum time claimed for keeping COLD beverages COLD)... I will check out of curiosity but no matter. I now know that I can make coffee the night before, leave the mess at home, and take 12 cups of steaming good coffee to the meetings the next morning. I also like the look and convenience of this stainless steel airpot, The top releases at the hinge and is removable for easier cleaning, The pump tube is stainless steel. The carry-handle, lid, & certain parts of the pump tube assembly are some type of hard plastic... while the seals appear to be silicone rubber. The lid & pump assembly has a marked ON-OFF position to prevent accidental coffee delivery during transport. Overall I am well pleased with this product and am considering getting a second one for the Decaf crowd. Update: At 36 hours the \"HOT\" water when pumped into a cup was still hot enough that a black coffee drinker might have been happy to have it. Cream (real cream, not the powdered veggie-fat) & sugar users, perhaps not so happy. The capability of this airpot carafe to keep liquids hot is exceptionally good! I ordered and received a second Vondior airpot after completing this test... the first week of use of my first purchase the comments were positive for the \"hot coffee\" that no one knew was made 10-12 hours earlier. The negative comments were universally \"Can we also get one for Decaf?\" This past week... all happy campers with both Regular & Decaf. Just confusion about which was which since only Decaf had a label. That problem will be solved by the next meeting with SS hanging tags \"Coffee\" & \"Decaf\" designating airpot contents.

I take a gallon of Russian Tea to our church Christmas party each year and it is such a hassle to take the tea and a way to keep it warm through the service...

Read more | 5.0\nf you're a coffee lover looking to bring the festive spirit of Mardi Gras into your mornings, these Community Coffee King Cake pods are a delightful choice. The medium roast is smooth and perfectly balanced, with a comforting blend of cinnamon and vanilla flavors that truly capture the essence of a king cake. The aroma is heavenly, filling the kitchen with a warm, spiced scent as it brews. The flavor isn't overly sweet or artificial, which makes it perfect for those who want a hint of indulgence without overwhelming their cup. Adding a splash of cream really enhances the flavor profile, but it’s equally enjoyable black. The pods are compatible with Keurig 2.0 brewers, and I had no issues with brewing or performance. Each cup is consistent in taste and strength. The box of 12 pods is a convenient size for trying out the flavor or adding variety to your coffee routine, though I wish it came in larger packs—I’ll definitely be ordering more!

    "reviews": "48 Pack 24 Pack 18 Pack 12 Pack 6 Pack I recently tried the BREZ Lion’s Mane Drink, and overall, I’m really impressed by the experience. The first thing that caught my attention was the unique, refreshing flavor—it’s sparkling with hints of Italian lemon and elderflower that make it both crisp and pleasantly tangy without being too sweet. I appreciated the thoughtfully crafted blend; with 2200mg of Lion’s Mane, cacao, black seed oil, and L-Theanine, I felt a gentle, uplifting boost that left me relaxed yet focused—perfect for those social evenings or a quiet night in. I also value that it’s THC & CBD free, so I can enjoy it anytime without any concerns. If I were to offer one suggestion, it might be to amp up the flavor intensity slightly for days when I need a bit more of a kick. However, this minor point aside, BREZ Lion’s Mane Drink has become a welcome part of my routine, delivering a balanced and mood-enhancing experience that truly lives up to its promise. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste of the product is fantastic, and I love all the good stuff in it. I definitely felt relaxed, although not necessarily clear headed. It wasn't nearly the same effect as drinking a canned alcohol, but I did enjoy it. My biggest drawback would be the price per can. I don't feel it's worth $7 per drink. Read more | 4.0\nThis stuff is fine. It's not any better than it's competitors that are almost half the price. Tastes ok. They didn't have a variety pack and I'm not spending another $35 to taste another flavor. I get zero \"high\" it relaxation or whatever from any of them. Idk if that's because I'm 240 and i need to pound 3 of them to feel it, but I'm not going to do that to find out. Read more | 3.0\nI love the BREZ Flow Lion’s Mane Mushroom Drink in Sparkling Lemon Elderflower Tonic! It’s light, crisp, and refreshing, with a perfect balance of zesty lemon and floral elderflower. The adaptogens provide a natural boost, helping me feel focused and uplifted without any jitters. Great for work, socializing, or unwinding, and the light carbonation makes it extra enjoyable. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a delicious, feel-good drink! Read more | 5.0\nMy initial reaction to this drink is that it is a 10/10 and soo tasty. It’s kind of like drinking a cocktail, which makes it much nicer, because now I have something to grab after work or while cooking or something when I don’t necessarily want to drink. The flavor is very pretty. It’s light and refreshing and..this is hard to explain..but it feels smooth the tastebuds, like a velvety mouth feel after the initial sparkle, if that makes sense. The lemon does overpower the elderflower a bit (you can still get a hint of the elderflower) but I mostly noticed the tartness of the lemon. I can’t say that I definitely felt the calming effects but I did feel something. Now was it a placebo? I don’t know but I did feel very rested and a bit sleepy after (and after months of not sleeping, I did get a full nights rest so that must mean something worked) Read more | 5.0\nFirst, I have to say I was very excited about this purchase. I have been alcohol free since January and was really looking for a nice alternative, something that would relax me that I could drink while watching a TV show with my husband. I tried my first one while eating dinner. I had a full stomach and honestly, I did not notice a whole lot of effect. I felt slightly lightheaded when I was putting the dishes away. Other than that, I did not feel anything. And I should say, I am a novice, I have not had a whole lot of experience with anything other than alcohol. So I decided to give this another try the next day on an empty stomach. I drank the lions mane at about 10 AM during the workday. Within about 15 minutes, I felt a tightening in my chest and my tongue started to tingle. This feeling  became worse over the next hour. It was uncomfortable, not a full out anxiety attack, but definitely uncomfortable. I did not feel relaxed. Unfortunately the sensation continued even after I ate breakfast and lunch. I took a nap and things seemed a bit better. However, I still noticed a lingering chest tightness up until the time I went to bed that night.  Because of this experience, I do not think I will be opening up another can. I don’t think this is for me. So I was disappointed. I have to say, however, the taste was excellent. Unfortunately, you cannot return this item so I am stuck with it. I will probably give the remaining cans out to friends. Maybe it will work for you. I believe everybody’s experience will be different. Even the two experiences I had were very different. Read more | 2.0\nThese checked all the boxes for me- tasty, low calorie, not loaded with sugar, and non-alcoholic. The only downsides are the limited flavors and the price. Unlike other mocktail products, these do have a slight relaxing energy to them- they’re energizing like a tea but also have a calming effect so you don’t feel jittery or anxious. I would say if you are looking for the adaptogen experience, these are definitely the best on the market, if you’re just looking for tasty, there are definitely cheaper products with more flavor variety. Overall, I would probably order again for a special occasion. Read more | 4.0\nWay too expensive for what you get.  I did like it.  It's an acquired taste.  A little odd at first but it is overall a pleasant taste so it doesn't take long to get used to it.  Effects, hard to say, maybe a little, but I never drank more than two at a time.  Again, I paid over $30 for six and that is just too much for this product in my opinion, I'm not buying it again until it is cheaper. Read more | 3.0",

    "reviews": "Variety Tropical Paradise Punch Original Variety Orange Twist Mango Tango Citrus Burst Cherry Lime Watermelon Crush I usually don’t like the typical energy drinks like Monster or Red Bull, but I LOVE this brand! My favorite thing about these energy drinks is that they are nutritionist-friendly. I even sent the nutritional facts to my nutritionist, and she said she’s going to start recommending this drink to other clients who are trying to make healthier choices. The Jaclyn Hill Orange Twist flavor is so refreshing, and the Electric Berry is another favorite of mine. With 150mg of caffeine, it gives me just the right amount of energy without any crash. Other claims: vegan, low calorie, and packed with natural ingredients like green tea caffeine and biotin—such a win! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a healthier energy drink alternative. Read more | 5.0\nThis is literally one of my favorite flavors of all time. The reason I found out about Gorgie is because of this Jaclyn Hill. So this flavor means the world to me. It’s not too sweet it’s the perfect amount of flavor. Before discovering Gorgie, I was cycling through energy drinks like Red Bull, C4, Alani, Monster, and even coffee. Almost all of them gave me anxiety, jitters, and that unpleasant tingling feeling all over my body. The crashes afterward were even worse. That all changed when I found Gorgie. These energy drinks are a total game-changer! They give me a natural, healthy boost of energy that lasts all day, without any anxiety or crashes. Honestly, I’ve never looked back. I’ve completely replaced coffee with Gorgie, and I couldn’t be happier. If you’re on the fence, don’t hesitate—just try it! 100,000/10. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\nI hate coffee, but I need caffeine in the morning; unfortunately, so many energy drinks are terrible for you. I am glad that Gorgie created a healthier alternative. One of the things I love about Gorgie is that they have a reasonable amount of biotin (100% DV). So many drinks or supplements that add biotin put in a ridiculous amount, like 10,000% your daily value, which for me and many others causes acne. Gorgie uses the perfect amount. I haven't really noticed a benefit from the l-theanine, but it is there. As for the flavors, I find the watermelon to be the best by far. I find the tropical punch to not have much flavor, and it is instead tastes more like a vaguely flavored sparkling drink, which isn't bad but also isn't good. The peach flavor is not good in my opinion, but not bad enough where I won't finish it. It has a very weird flavor sadly, which stinks because I love peach. I think it has something to do with its sweetener as it has a slight maple syrup aftertaste. Read more | 4.0\nThe main reason I bought it was for the ingredients especially minus suclarose, erythrotol, and aspartame! That’s huge! Taste good!  If they can keep the price at around 20$ for the 12 pack I am all in! Read more | 5.0\nI have been looking for a healthy energy drink and am thrilled to finally find Gorgie.  I love the taste and the ingredients! No energy crash.  I hope they continue the coupons that make it more affordable. Read more | 5.0\nThese are so refreshing and delicious! Perfect amount of caffeine for a pick me up. I wish they came in a smaller size though. I have a hard time finishing a full one. Read more | 5.0\nI wouldn’t buy this variety pack again just because of how awful the peach flavor was. Didn’t taste like peach at all and left a horrible after taste. The other two flavors were pretty good. Read more | 3.0\nDecent taste. But let's face it we drink these for energy and can't expect it to taste amazing. It has the right amount of caffeine to give you just enough boost. A bit pricey which leads to a 1 star off. Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "Strawberry Lemon Mixed Berry Mango Peach I love the Strawberry Lemonspark flavor, and I get a good energy kick from it. Well carbonated. Bonus points for the collagen, vitamins and prebiotics. This is my favorite energy drink by far. Read more | 5.0\nI was a little shocked to see the poor rating and reviews on this product. But then I tasted the Strawberry Lemonspark lol Yeah, there's an aftertaste on that one, but I thought that the Mango Peachpop was great! I have some eczema issues with Guarana so have to keep a limit on it and finally found a high caffeine drink with natural sweeteners as opposed to being infested with chemical sweeteners and on top of that some good vitamins in it and at the best price by far that I've found. Who knows, maybe all the bad reviews is what's keeping this product's price down lolol But for this price, no BS chemicals-all natural ingredients, 200mg caffeine, @ $20 a 12 pack? I can deal with as little aftertaste for now and when I finish the Strawberry Lemonspark and stick with the Mango Peachpop. Would like to try the Mixed Berry but for some reason it's always \"Unavailable\" Read more | 5.0\nBought this on Amazon and then a C4 variety pack and the Alani ? variety packs from Costco and these are, by far, the worst tasting of the 3.  The C4 has 3 flavors in their variety pack and the Alani's had 3 in their variety packso worst out of 7 flavors?  After one month these are still left in the fridge because I just don't enjoy the flavor.  I'll gulp them down but I won't repurchase them.  I thought I would enjoy them but they are more sparkling water flavor than other sugar free energy drinks out there. Read more | 1.0\nTaste is meh at best.  Lots of caffeine and no sucralose. Read more | 4.0\nI wanted to try these out specifically because the price was so cheap. Maybe that was for a reason though. Obviously take this review as my taste experience, but these were hard to finish. I always stick to sugar free energy drinks but these after tastes was very hard to take the next sip. It was the first energy drink I had that had collagen in it, so maybe that was the after taste. I had to start chugging these down rather than sip on them. With that being said, they worked good for a minor pre workout, but the effects were no where near an actual pre workout. So don’t think you’re getting that with these. Again, try these for yourself. The taste wasn’t the worst, but was far from the best. Read more | 3.0\nDespite mostly negative reviews, I wanted to give the product a try for myself during prime deals day. The caffeine definitely perks me up but it's not a product you can drink warm or pour over ice. I found that if I chilled the drink for a couple days or freeze it just enough to be almost a slush, it'll be tasty enough to drink. Otherwise, I think this is a bad blue raspberry flavor attempt. Read more | 2.0\nGreat healthy alternative to energy drinks, with no caffeine “drop off” Read more | 5.0\nAfter searching for an energy drink without any artificial sweeteners, I stumbled upon this drink. Contains stevia and monk fruit juice as natural sweeteners, which do not taste bad in my opinion. Obviously this does not taste like a lot of other energy drinks pack with artificial sweeteners and sugars, but I was accustomed to it after a few sips. I usually finish about half a can a day, which gives me plenty of energy, especially before workouts. This drink has been integral in my weight loss of 50pounds in just a couple months. I feel like the bad reviews are from people uninformed about the direction of this drink; they should stick to others. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "The weight watchers chocolate shakes taste is very good. Satisfying. Price was less than I can buy at the grocery store. Easy to grab and go. I haven’t purchased them in the past few months because I found a different brand with higher protein. Which is a priority for me. Read more | 5.0\nI love these.  I’m not always hungry for a meal. It does make you feel full for at least four hours.  Adkins and Premiere taste great but I don’t feel full after drinking them.  I love the taste.  I needed something low carb and some protein. It is convenient too. Read more | 5.0\nThis is my personal experience/opinion, but I truly believe this product helped alleviate my hunger and helped me heal faster. It also came in handy when I had to take my antibiotics. More specifically, when I took my antibiotics on a empty stomach, I was having this bizarre stomach pain; but with this slim fast drink, I didn't feel anything. The taste of this drink is what I expected. Since it has a lot of vitamins and protein, I expected the flavor to be slightly unpleasant and the texture to be a little thick; and I was right. It also has a strong artificial vanilla flavor with artificial sweetener. Overall, the flavor isn't the greatest but it's not bad to the point where I couldn't drink it. In fact, after my 2nd slim fast, I got use to the flavor and started to enjoy it. I'm more grateful that I actually felt satisfied both physically and mentally. I also noticed that the majority of negative reviews are due to expired products. Luckily for me, I didn't have that issue. To end this, if you have any type of oral surgery coming up that will require you to be on a liquid diet, try this first and see if you like it BEFORE YOUR SURGERY. Of course, see if you can get your hand on a single slim fast before you buy this bulk lol Thanks Amazon and Slim Fast 💙 Read more | 5.0\nThey taste great and curve my hunger during the day. I just wish they were a bit larger. Can finish one in no time at all. Read more | 4.0\n5/26/2023: I'm starting a new diet and weight loss plan using Slimfast, healthier meals, and by staying active for at least 30 minutes a day. My starting weight is 185 and I am 5'5\" tall. The goal is to lose 40 pounds. After getting the approval from my doctor, I bought the energy Mocha Cappuccino Slimfast shakes for energy in the morning and I bought regular Slimfast shakes to drink midday. It states on the bottle that in order to lose weight, you can have one meal a day (having at least 1,200 calories a day in total), replace two meals with either shakes smoothies or bars, and you can have up to three snacks. I find this pretty sensible. The shake itself is delicious. There is no chalky taste, either. The cappuccino taste isn't too strong but it's still good. The consistency is thin, not thick like a shake normally would be but this doesn't bother me. I'd say it works so far. I woke up after having a rough nights sleep and this shake gave me the energy boost I needed to start the day and I'm also full as well. We'll see how long the full feeling lasts. If you are trying to lose weight this way, go in to it with the right expectations. I don't think the shake alone is meant to keep you full for hours. It does HELP to keep you full, but you still have to have snacks in between and a decent meal. Will update the review in the future to give results. Good luck to anyone else trying to lose weight! We got this! Read more | 5.0\nThis is now my favorite protein drink!! Flavorful,  no chalky after taste, not super thick, and just the perfect amount for a breakfast or lunch replacement.

Some have described Alfred Peet as the “big bang” of craft coffee, the one who started it all. When he set up shop in Berkeley back in 1966, he transformed America’s expectations of the depth, body, and flavor in our cups. And that pursuit of greatness has never stopped. In 2016, we honored his legacy by taking a bold step ahead. Like Mr. Peet’s pioneering dark roasts, this blend expands the horizon of what coffee can be: vibrant, full-flavored, boldly original, and roasted to medium-bodied perfection. If you love Major Dickason’s one-of-a-kind taste, you’ll find a kindred spirit in Big Bang.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to! The flavor is AMAZING! Energy is AMAZING! And it’s perfect for someone on keto looking for an energy boost! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n1.0\n4.0",

    "reviews": "Peach Tea Berry Bestsellers Variety I love Gorgie energy drinks. They give you a nice boost of energy that lasts and doesn’t give you a crash. I like that they’re made with green tea for energy and also have vitamins like biotin and b vitamins. I love the different flavor options, you can make a decent mocktail/cocktail from them too. They’re pretty clean as far as an energy drink goes. I do feel like they’re a better choice as far as energy drinks are concerned because they’re ingredient list so clean and the energy source seems better for you. I’ve been buying them for a few months now, this time I committed to a 12 pack because I drink them so regularly now. I genuinely enjoy them and the benefits I see. It helps lift my midday crash without any weird side effects. Definitely a favorite of mine and definitely would recommend. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been looking for a great tasting, clean energy drink for quite some time and finally found it.  The Gorgie energy drinks are phenomenal! I got the variety pack and my favorite is hard to pick but I’m going to go with watermelon splash! I like the energy I get from this product which comes from green tea. There is no shaky feeling or digestion issues.  I love that there is no sugar in this product and how there is only 5 calories. This is so easy to drink and I like it best refrigerated! This is definitely my new go to energy drink and I highly recommend it! Read more | 5.0\nThe drink is a bit expensive but for an alternative to regular caffeine, price to performance is not bad. I drank one around 2pm and couldn’t sleep till 3am, but that is only because I don’t drink a lot of caffeine regularly. One of the things I like the most about this is that it did not hurt my stomachs. Normally when I have any energy drink like monster or redbull it hurts my stomachs afterwards and generally causes me problems. So far this has not happened at all drinking this. As far as taste goes it tastes like mildly sweet sparkling water, nothing amazing but not super bad. Read more | 4.0\nI had the opportunity to try Gorgie’s Bestsellers Variety Pack, and I absolutely love that it delivers a smooth energy boost without any jitters! It’s refreshing to find an energy drink that works effectively while being functional for daily use.One thing to note is that the flavors didn’t quite hit the mark for me. While I enjoyed the Mango and Watermelon the most, I found that the overall taste could use some refinement. I also noticed that shaking the cans well before drinking made a significant difference in the experience, though the flavor profile was still not quite to my liking. I truly appreciate the brand’s dedication to clean ingredients and performance-driven beverages. With some adjustments to the flavors, this could easily become a go-to option for many! Read more | 3.0\nReally love having a Gorgie every day to help me through my mid day slump! Each flavor is fantastic and I love all of the added functional ingredients. They have a great amount of carbonation and a strong flavor. I don’t get any jitters after drinking. Love the bright colored cans! Read more | 5.0\nI picked one of these up at the grocery store and then order a pack. I was surprised to see it wasn’t rated that highly. I love these! They taste great and give a good boost. I have tried all the flavors and like them all. I’m pretty picky about sugar substitutes and am pretty sensitive to the bitter aftertaste they can leave, even stevia. But these taste good. Definitely the best healthy/natural energy drinks I’ve ever had! Read more | 5.0\nI love how there are great ingredients in this product, and how they don't overload on biotin which can cause acne when you get too much. I love 3/4 flavors in this variety pack and the peach flavor is only okay. It is a little too syrupy and fake sugar flavored for my tastes, but it is tolerable usually. However, the last time I received this product the peach flavor was adulterated. There were giant chunks of this like chalky substance throughout the drink and reporting the issue did not result in any fixes. Therefore, I cannot trust this product in the future. Read more | 2.0\nI love the ingredients used, and it works. I got the variety pack bc I wanted to taste the flavors. I don't like the Mango and definitely do not like the peach tea. I didn't realize it was peach tea flavor, I just thought is was peach. Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "Root Beer Peach Mango Orange Sunrise Grape Dr. Bum Citrus Burst Cherry Frost Champion Mentality Blueberry Lemonade Blue Snow Cone Pink Lemonade I love BUM Energy drinks, I can't get enough of them, I guess you could say I'm addicted, a true BUMaholic(TM). Sorry Chris, can't use that one. BUM Energy drinks are unique. They taste like a soda, feel like a soda, and look like one. I'm tired of the overly sweet, 300mg caffeine energy drinks trying to get the biggest can out there for consumer gluttony. So when I found BUM, I gave it a try and became hooked. BUM energy drinks give you a slight caffeine boost and uptick in mental clarity. I enjoy a cup or two of coffee in the morning, but in the afternoon I'll drink one of these to keep me going before a workout. I have had almost every flavor of BUM, there is still the elusive pink lemonade I haven't been able to find yet. But for flavor ratings: Cherry Frost : tastes like a Cherry Cola. The best in my opinion. Root Beer: does have a slight \"diet\" flavor, but the best of the root beer energy drinks I've had. If you enjoy root beer you'll enjoy this. Cirtus Blast: If you're familiar with Sprite or 7up, this is very similar: crisp, clean citrus flavor. Champion Mentality: tough choice between this and orange sunrise. Champion Mentality takes this spot for me because it is lighter on the sweetness. Slightly more tart flavor than Citrus Blast. Orange Sunrise: A bit, sweet, but not too much. Almost like an orange popsicle, but very refreshing. Blue Snow Cone: its been a while since I have had this one, a little harder to find at times. It's a sweet flavor, very reminiscent of the \"blue\" flavor of similar drinks. IYKYK Blueberry Lemonade: this is tangy, very slight blueberry flavor with a tangy, acidic after taste. I find this to be a refreshing, sipping beverage. It gets me excited for the pink lemonade! Peach Mango: I'm a huge fan of these two flavors and the combination had me excited. I found it to be a little on the sweet side with a bit more \"diet\" taste. Still a very refreshing drink and one to try if you're a fan of the flavor combination. If you haven't tried BUM Energy drinks yet, you're missing out on the best energy drinks out there. For those of you who like energy drinks, give these a try. One sip and you'll be hooked, switching from the Reigns, Bangs, Monsters, etc. You just cannot beat the quality of these drinks, you get no jitters or crash, just clean energy. Chris, how about a simple \"Cola\" flavor? And don't change the cans, I love the simplicity of a 12oz soda can. Read more | 5.0\nI'm writing because the review checker gives the quality of reviews on this listing an F... but I purchased this product bc I'm trying to lower the amount of caffeine I drink (I was drinking A LOT for me to be coming down to BUM's level). Suffice to say, I've now gone through one pack and I am now a customer. the product is EXCELLENT. Just enough caffeine, it's not a giantic can of drinnk so you don't feel bloated like with a monster or ghost or rockstar and above all... The ROOTBEER is EXCELLENT. Like wow, the taste is great. Cannot emphasize to you that after drinking dozens of brands over the decades that this one is a stand out. I am waiting on their Dr. Bum flavor... and I wish they would come out with a Cola flavor but so far, I want to commend them on a great product in the midrange Caffeination (is that word? IS NOW !) for folks who are discovering that their kidneys might matter in the future. KEep up the good work Bum! Read more | 5.0\nGreat product, the flavor is on point and ingredients are awesome!

Definitely buying more! Read more | 5.0\nThe root beer flavor tastes just like root beer, no weird after taste or artificial sweetener flavor. The caffeine pick-me-up is just right, enough to wake me up but not too strong to cause jitters or a crash.

    "reviews": "Mixed Tray Blueberry Tart Orange Cream VALR Energy has quickly become my favorite energy drink! The flavor is perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and it gives me hours of smooth, focused energy without the jitters or dreaded crash. Knowing it’s made with natural ingredients makes it an easy, guilt-free choice for staying energized throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the two flavor pack with Orange Cream and Blueberry Tart. Orange Cream was my personal favorite out of the 2. As someone that is picky with energy drinks, I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. Neither had that fake energy drink taste that some of the other brands on the market have. The were tasty but not too sweet. The caffeine content was perfect to give you mental focus but none of the weird jittery feeling. I felt focused and awake all day without any crash also! The nitrogen gives the drinks a little bit of carbonation without being overpowering. As someone that also prioritizes their health, I really like that this brand has clean ingredients and is more geared toward a healthy lifestyle. 10/10 would buy again and recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using VALR Nitrogen Infused energy drinks for a few weeks now, and I’m impressed with the boost they provide without the usual jitters. As an active mother, I need something that helps with both focus and stamina during my workouts, and this does the trick. The smooth, refreshing taste makes it easy to enjoy, and I love that it doesn’t leave me feeling drained later on. Overall, it’s a great energy drink that supports my busy lifestyle Read more | 5.0\nI’m usually pretty hesitant to try most energy drinks because they make me jittery and often taste like chemicals, but I decided to try VALR because of the green tea extract and nitrogenation.. and this is actually delicious! The nitrogen makes the liquid feel thicker/gives the satisfaction of carbonation, without the actual bubbles or gas aftermath.  I got the variety pack to try both flavors- the orange reminded me of an orange and cream sorbet, and the blueberry (my fav) literally just tasted like blueberry green tea. I have the mental and physical energy, without feeling anxious or shaky. Definitely recommend at least giving them a try!! Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who's pretty sensitive to caffeine, this was a nice mid-day pick me up and I could feel my alertness level rise after drinking less than half the can, no jitters. The sweetness level works for me (I like sweet drinks) and the fact that it's infused with nitrogen makes for a really smooth texture that felt like a treat. I'm going to start having one before my workout classes. Orange is my fav - will continue to repurchase! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of an energy drink consumer because most of the drinks on the market have way too much caffeine! The can only has 175mg of caffeine through green tea. I did not experience any weird jitters or crashes after drinking the entire can. The other things I love about the product is its focus on natural juices and flavoring as well as it being nitrogenated. I was also able to drink an entire can before a workout with no bloat that you would typically get from a carbonated drink making my workout comfortable. This is a great product! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been searching for a clean, effective energy drink, and VALR is now my go-to. The taste is refreshing and not overly sweet, which I love. It provides a steady energy boost that keeps me focused for hours without the jittery feeling or crash I’ve experienced with other brands. Plus, it’s packed with natural ingredients, which makes me feel good about drinking it. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nVALR is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the orange, but the blueberry is also super satisfying. I was expecting carbonation like other energy drinks, but the nitrogenated texture was a pleasant surprise. It’s a bit thicker but without the carbonation, so no burping side effects! I’m focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough protein while leading a healthy lifestyle. One thing I love about Valr is that it mixes perfectly with my clear protein powder for a refreshing, energizing boost. It’s delicious on its own and even better with protein. I can’t say enough great things about this energy drink! The energy boost from Valr is different from other drinks. It doesn’t give me a big spike and then a crash. Instead, it provides a natural, lasting boost that maximizes my focus, energy levels, and attentiveness, making it a great companion for my workday mornings. I’m a die-hard fan of the orange flavor and can’t wait to start all my days with it. I’ll be ordering another case soon! I would love to try other flavors as they come out with new ones!

    "reviews": "I snagged a 12-pack of CELSIUS Sparkling Kiwi Guava, and dude, it’s my new pre-workout jam! The kiwi-guava combo is tart, sweet, and tropical—sips like a vacation vibe. No sugar, no junk like aspartame or high fructose corn syrup, just clean energy from green tea and guarana. I felt the kick without the jitters, thanks to that MetaPlus blend with B vitamins and chromium—kept me pumped and not starving mid-run. It’s vegan, gluten-free, and Kosher, so it fits my picky diet. The 12 oz. slim cans are clutch for on-the-go. Only beef? It’s fizzy, so if you’re not into carbonation, heads-up. Otherwise, it’s a solid pick-me-up for crushing goals and staying fit without the usual energy drink crash. CELSIUS, you’ve got a fan! Read more | 5.0\nThe CELSIUS Arctic Vibe Sparkling Frozen Berry is my absolute go-to energy drink! As a mom of three, working from home, and streaming, I need something to keep me going—and this does the job without the crash! What I Love: ✔ Great Flavor – The Frozen Berry taste is refreshing and not overly sweet. It’s my favorite from the Celsius lineup! ✔ Clean Energy Boost – Gives me just the right amount of energy without the jittery feeling. Perfect for long work hours and late-night streams. ✔ No Crash – Unlike other energy drinks, I don’t feel sluggish after it wears off. ✔ Zero Sugar, But Still Tastes Great – Love that it’s sugar-free yet still delicious and satisfying. ✔ Keeps Me Productive – Whether it’s chasing my kids, grinding through work, or keeping up with my gaming sessions, this drink helps me stay focused and energized.

Read more | 5.0\nAs part of my fitness regimen, I started drinking Celsius zero energy drink to boost my performance. Since I began consuming the drink, I have observed improved energy levels during workouts and faster perspiration. I am particularly fond of the peach, fruit punch, and tropical pineapple flavors. Considering the cost, I believe it offers good value for money. However, I must note that the drink contains caffeine, which can cause stomach irritation if I consume the entire can. To avoid this issue, I limit my intake to half a can. Read more | 5.0\nThis is the perfect energy drink I will ever get.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it!

Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Bundle C4 Smart Energy Official Variety Pack Watermelon Burst Tropical Passion-fruit Tropical Oasis Variety Pack Strawberry Guava Peach Mango Nectar Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Yuzu Black Cherry Berry Breeze Variety Pack C4 Brain & Body Official Variety Pack Cherry Berry Lime The media could not be loaded. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost.

    "reviews": "Tropical Thrill Son of a Peach Rizzberry and Cream Red Ryder Punch Orange Drizzle OG Luck Bodacious Berry Variety Pack When I performed a search for energy drinks, Lucky Energy appeared as a sponsored result. Curious to learn more, I clicked on it. I was moved by the creators backstory and why Lucky energy became a thing. Upon looking at the range of flavor profiles offered, I went with the variety pack. However, at an almost eye watering $30 for just 10 cans, I was hesitant at first but nonetheless they arrived the next day. Again, love the backstory but also the packaging/design of everything. To me, this is a well put together brand with the different flavors offered and the design of the can. Everyone always asks me what I'm drinking. All in all I like the drink so far, I haven't tried all the flavors just yet but have tried 3 so far and all of them have tasted clean, crisp, and delicious. Not overly sweet like some low sugar/sugar free drinks are with all that fake sweetener and whatnot. This is just right. The only con I can say is the price. Coming in at $3/can is a little higher some might argue. That's what you'd normally pay at a gas station. I'm used to paying anywhere between $1.50/$2 a can when ordering online in bulk. However, at the end of the day this seems to be still a new product and maybe prices will change and times goes on and they get bigger, things get more affordable for them, etc. I can get behind paying the little extra though because I feel good about supporting someone with such a memorable backstory and purpose for a product. I would give these a try if you haven't. Very good and will probably be ordering more at a later date. Read more | 5.0\nMove over Rockstar, Redbull, and Monster. There’s a new king in town, and its name is Lucky Energy. That’s right, I said it: best energy drink out there. And trust me, I’m not throwing that title around lightly as someone who’s basically an energy drink connoisseur. What sets Lucky Energy apart is that it’s made with clean ingredients. Unlike most energy drinks that leave you feeling guilty for what you’re putting into your body, this one feels like a smarter choice. I get all the benefits—energy, focus, and even a surprising mood boost, without that nagging \"am I slowly destroying myself?\" feeling. The energy is smooth, too. There’s no crash, which is honestly a game-changer. I can power through my day without suddenly feeling like I got hit by a truck. Plus, it’s so good that I ended up buying six cases after trying it. Yeah, it’s that good. And the best part? It’s actually cheaper than the big-name brands you find in liquor stores. If you’re looking for an energy drink that works, tastes great, and doesn’t come with a side of regret, Lucky Energy is your answer. Do yourself a favor and stock up, you won’t regret it. Read more | 5.0\nI loved this energy drink, the flavor, size of can and price was reasonable.  Now I go back to buy it again and the flavor is not available in the 19oz can, which is fine because I'm patient and they will restock, but then I see they hiked up the price 10 dollars a 12 pack and the 16oz cans cost 5 dollars more than the original price for the bigger can.  If you find something you like at a great price buy as many as you can cause it's never gonna go down.  Now I can't afford this anymore.  On to the next one.  Happens with everything.  I understand a dollar even 2 but 10.  That's when it's time to move on.  When this happens company's are saying to me, greed is more important than long term loyalty to customer base.  Bait and switch on a lot of products I'm noticing. Read more | 4.0\nThese are my new favorite and goto energy drinks. The OG Luck flavor is really good—not too sweet and no weird aftertaste like so many others I’ve tried. It gives a nice boost of energy without making me feel jittery or crashing later. I like that it has 200mg of caffeine and added ingredients like maca and ginseng for an extra kick. Overall, it’s a solid energy drink that tastes great and works well. Definitely worth trying if you’re looking for a healthier option! Read more | 5.0\nLove the flavor of the organs cream and definitely feel the energy.  Also love the story of the owner of the company Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is okay but has a brewed after taste. Better tasting energy drinks out there for the same or better price. Read more | 3.0\nI dont like coffee particularly but I like a little kick in the mornings so naturally energy drinks have always been my go to. I don't like the high caffeine content of some of them though, there is a such thing as too much buzz. It has a good amount of caffeine but not too much and the ingredients are a lot more basic than others. I like the fact that they use vegetable juice for their colors instead of the nasty food coloring. They seem to be right in line price wise with everybody else. These will be my new go to, from dirt bikes to surfing to work. Read more | 5.0\nOg luck taste great! Taste just like a green monster but with out all the junk monster has in it. You can definitely tell after you've drank a can, it does have a slight taste of the zero sugar but nothing to noticeable after my first can I hardly noticed it. No bad aftertaste doesn't make me jittery and I don't feel like crashing out either. Overall i would definitely recommend this energy drink to anyone willing to give it a shot. I've only tried the og luck so I can't comment on the other flavors but OG Luck is a must try if you like the taste of the green monsters. 4 out of 5 stars because the pricing could be a little cheaper other than that I've seen people complain about damaged cans i haven't had that problem yet my packaging was perfect and was delivered on time. Also this is not a paid review I just wanted to share my experience. Update: Second shipment over half the cans are damaged. Read more | 4.0",

Read more | 5.0\nWow, the reviews for this energy drink are *terrible* - not sure why - but I found this drink to be surprisingly good! It appears that I am in the minority here, but hear me out: Okay, so I have never had a Rockstar energy drink (what can I say, I live a 'sheltered life,' lol); so I honestly cannot compare to previous formulas, like most of the reviewers here have done. That said, I was surprised... and only in a *good* way! There were NO bad \"surprises,\" at all, whatsoever — and no \"cons!\" I have had \"Monster\" energy drinks... and found the taste to be awful. I have had \"Red Bull\" ... and I found those to be *EVEN WORSE!* I literally cannot stomach red bull energy drinks - they are that gross to me! They turn my stomach. They taste like *medicine* to me... actually, no, I've had *medicine* that tastes better! (Sorry, Red Bull fans... but we're gonna have to agree to disagree here, lol) So, I was a little trepidatious — to say the least — when it came to ordering these. (Luckily, I didn't even *look* at the reviews; and I'm so glad I didn't! (I don't say that line very often, lol). So, the day of my first taste came... and I was shocked - and only in a good way!! This is the *ONLY* energy drink that I have ever liked - or can even \"stomach,\" for that matter. Seriously. I love my caffeine — and who can't use a little \"extra\" energy or OOMPH in their day?? As someone who has CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and an autoimmune disorder that I've struggled with since *childhood* —  as well as various other health issues, I will say that *I* certainly can! So, anyway, onto the taste: For those that have never tasted this particular drink/flavor, but are familiar with Mountain Dew (I also enjoy many of *their* flavors; *especially* the orange \"Livewire\" - which is my favorite Mt Dew flavor), I will say that, to me, it tastes very much like a subdued (and less carbonated) version of their orange LIVEWIRE. That is the closest thing I can compare it to. It's perfect for me! The pick-me-up was also appreciated - and I also felt it delivered a good \"jolt\" (pun intended) of energy; in other words, it served its purpose and lived up to its name — it gave me some much-needed energy and the taste is great, to me!! If you've never had a Rockstar energy drink, and are not even familiar with the \"old\" formula vs the \"new\" formula and/or you enjoy Mt Dew LiveWire, give this a go!! I think you will enjoy it. If not, I'm sorry but I offer no money-back guarantees, lol. Bottom Line? For those searching for a new energy drink or a new flavor, and are wondering what this tastes like: It's a nice soft, subtle orange-y flavor reminiscent of Live Wire - so if you enjoy Mountain Dew's \"LiveWire,\" I think you would really enjoy this flavor! I did! Obviously, I feel a little \"alone\" in that opinion atm (according to other reviewers) but who cares?! All that matters to me is that I enjoyed it and that it added a little extra pizzaz to my day. I did - and it did! I hope you will enjoy it as well! Salud!

    "reviews": "Watermelon Strawberry Peach Hardcore Apple Berry Sangria Fruit Punch Always great, its really the only flavor I prefer. Love Rockstar! Tastes great, great quality. Always helps me get going in the morning with the caffeine. Priced well below the stores. Read more | 5.0\nI have been drinking Rockstar Punched energy for years. It has always been my favorite energy drink to make it through those extra-long shifts at work or power through tough workouts. The flavor is bold, and yeah, it definitely gives a strong energy kick if that's what I need. It had just about everything one could want: a bunch of caffeine and a load of sugar, too, which always really gave me that immediate kick. But as much as I've enjoyed rockstar over the years, recently I tried Aura caffeine pouches, and man, they're so much better. The first thing I noticed about Aura is how smooth and long-lasting the energy was. This was because, with Rockstar, I'd get a quick burst of energy, but that usually didn't last too long. Most times, by the end of the day, I crashed. However, Aura seems to give pretty steady energy, lasting for hours without making me jittery or wired. I think the nootropic blend makes a huge difference-ingredients such as Cognizin citicoline and theanine. I have a lot more energy, but also feel really focused and clear-headed, which wasn't the case with Rockstar. Of course, another big plus about Aura over Rockstar would be that it contains no sugar at all. Rockstar is a drink loaded with sugar, and although this may give me an immediate boost of energy, it could often make me feel a bit sluggish later on. Aura is sugar-free and made from clean, natural ingredients, so I don't have to be as concerned about crashing or feel guilty about what I'm taking. Plus, the sour gummy flavor is amazing, way more enjoyable than any Rockstar flavor I've tried. I grabbed mine here https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF35MFQP Aura is also a lot more convenient. With Rockstar, I always had to carry around a can and make sure to drink it before it got warm. But Aura pouches are small, easy to carry, and require no preparation whatsoever. I can pop a pouch in my mouth anytime I need an energy boost, at work, at the gym, or running errands; it's just so much more practical for my busy lifestyle. I still think Rockstar is not bad, but that's especially if you want just a quick shot of energy. However, Aura has become a much better choice for me: the energy is longer, cleaner, and it helps me stay focused without the side effects I used to get from drinking Rockstar. If you want more than your usual, ordinary energy drink, I strongly recommend trying the Aura pouches-you won't regret it! Read more | 5.0\nRockstar is the best energy drink. They have a variety of good flavors ( fruit punch is the best). 250 mg of caffeine is the perfect amount for me to sustain throughout the day. Highly recommend it.

I purchased the 16oz cans in a convenient 12-pack, and it has quickly become my go-to energy boost. The Fruit Punch flavor is incredibly refreshing, striking the perfect balance between sweetness and a tangy kick. Unlike some other energy drinks, Rockstar Punched doesn't have an overpowering artificial taste – it's just the right amount of flavor to invigorate your senses. What sets this energy drink apart is not just its taste but also its affordability. The 12-pack is priced competitively, making it an excellent value for the quality you get. I appreciate that I can enjoy a delicious energy boost without breaking the bank. The 16oz cans are also a great size, providing enough energy to power through my day without the need for constant refills. Whether I'm tackling a workout or just need a pick-me-up during a busy afternoon, Rockstar Punched has become my reliable companion. In conclusion, if you're looking for an energy drink that delivers on taste, quality, and affordability, Rockstar Punched in the Fruit Punch flavor is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing and invigorating experience without compromising on their budget. Read more | 5.0\nI love, love, love this flavor.

Read more | 5.0\nThis has been a particular favorite between my wife, teenage daughter, and I for a while.  We ended up getting it from Amazon since a lot of local places around us stopped carrying it. It taste more like a fruity drink over an energy drink, and is really nice and tasty when you have it closer to frozen temperature wise.  Very easy to go down and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste.  It is a little syrupy sweet, but nothing strong like Mountain Dew.  We actually prefer this one to the whipped orange, which sadly doesn't hit the nostalgia of a creamsicle bar as I was hoping it would. When we first had this on Subscribe and Save it was $15.99 for a pack of 12, so the prices seem to roughly close to the same.  The value is buying it in bulk, as an individual one of these is $2.49 at our local Kroger, so you are pretty much paying a little over less than a dollar each, which for 12 cans is pretty significant. Read more | 5.0\nDon't get me wrong, I bought this purely to support RockStar energy (I also bought the OG throwback to compare) but the OG flavor was truly better. I remember back In the days (when Rockstar was the first energy drink in the USA) that was my go to. Over Redbull, monster, Nos etc. Then they changed the \"formula\" to what is now called \"original\" and honestly I have no idea why. That made me stop drinking Rockstar for so long, I ended up converting to a NoS drinker then a Monster energy drinker. Thankfully they brought back the OG flavor with the \"throwback\" version and all I can say is KEEP THAT VERSION PERMANENTLY! They really are different and where I'm honestly just too old to vividly remember the \"taste\" of the actual OG Rockstar (to like, compare it to this \"throwback\" version) and I'm not LA beast over there drinking outdated \"vintage\" products just to \"remember\" them lol. I can definitely say that the OG one definitely reminded me of the OG flavor (hence it's name) and it definitely is a different taste than the \"now original\" flavor. So 4/5 I still support RockStar, it was the first energy drink I even fell in love with and picked over all the rest but I just don't agree with the \"change\", hence my 4/5. 5/5 for the OG flavor.

The plastic wrapping around the pack was damaged when it arrived, which made me a bit concerned about the cans inside. Fortunately, they were intact, but better care during packing or shipping would make for a better overall experience. Still, the drink itself is excellent, so I’m giving it 4 stars. Just a little extra attention to packaging would make it perfect! Read more | 4.0",

Read more | 4.0\nEver since I discovered these energy drinks, they have become a part of every morning. I don’t feel that I need to have one, like coffee, or other stimulant type of caffeine drink. I just like the taste, and the way that it energizes and starts my morning. One issue to be aware of of course is the fact that five hour energy does contain niacin. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just important to note that you should not drink the entire bottle all at once, particularly if you have had any type of low blood blood pressure problem  in the past, or you are taking medication for blood pressure. The niacin may cause a niacin rush as it is known and this may make you feel a little faint. Some people have actually reported that they drank the entire bottle and then fainted for a moment onto the floor.  The bottle itself warns against this and does indicate that you should not drink the entire bottle all at once. For me, I break it up into three parts I take a drink and then perhaps get dressed or take a shower then I drink another third, and perhaps read the daily newspaper  or answer email and then by the time I get into the car after about 30 or 40 minutes I drink the final third of the bottle. That is perfect for me no effects no dizziness and I am fully energized for the morning some of the flavors are not real wonderful, so choose the one that you like the best. For me it is the berry. I don’t particularly care for the watermelon. Read more | 5.0\nMy husband prefers 5 hour energies over a cup of coffee, especially when he is traveling long distance.  He has really no favorites and seems to like all the flavors.  He does really like this flavor - peach mango and tends to pick this one up more.  The multi pack is definitely a cheaper option than buying them one at  a time. Read more | 5.0\nMy morning caffeine comes from coffee, but my midday and afternoon boost comes from these 5 Hour Energy shots. I like the taste and the non jittery boost these give when the afternoon yawns start. I subscribed for monthly delivery because of the price and because my preferred variety (Berry flavored, Regular strength) is often unavailable at my local stores. So far my deliveries have arrived when scheduled. I will keep my subscription Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "Just finished a workout and feeling drained? Craving that sweet, lemony goodness, but also need a little pick-me-up? Look no further than Rockstar Recovery Lemonade! This isn't your average energy drink. It ditches the fizz for a smooth, lemonade taste and packs a punch with caffeine, electrolytes, and B vitamins. Think of it as a post-workout reward that also gives you a little extra oomph. Tastes great: Seriously, it's like sunshine in a can. No fizz: Perfect if you're not a fan of the bubbly stuff. Electrolytes: Helps you rehydrate after sweating it out. B vitamins: May give you a little extra pep in your step. Sugar-free: Bonus points for those watching their sugar intake. But before you go chugging a whole case, keep this in mind: The \"shock\" comes from the caffeine: 160mg is a lot, so be mindful of jitters and avoid downing them like soda. Artificial sweeteners: Not everyone's a fan, and there's some debate about their health effects. It's not magic: A healthy diet and exercise are still your best bet for long-lasting energy. Overall, Rockstar Recovery Lemonade is a decent choice for an occasional pick-me-up, especially after exercise. Read more | 5.0\nNice low carb sugar option without weird aftertaste.

It has slightly less caffeine than other options which is also good for those that don’t want to be overly caffeinated or jittery and I enjoy that it isn’t carbonated or as much of the typical energy drink fruity flavors that can be a bit sickening to me at times.

Read more | 5.0\nThis has been a particular favorite between my wife, teenage daughter, and I for a while.  We ended up getting it from Amazon since a lot of local places around us stopped carrying it. It taste more like a fruity drink over an energy drink, and is really nice and tasty when you have it closer to frozen temperature wise.  Very easy to go down and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste.  It is a little syrupy sweet, but nothing strong like Mountain Dew.  We actually prefer this one to the whipped orange, which sadly doesn't hit the nostalgia of a creamsicle bar as I was hoping it would. When we first had this on Subscribe and Save it was $15.99 for a pack of 12, so the prices seem to roughly close to the same.  The value is buying it in bulk, as an individual one of these is $2.49 at our local Kroger, so you are pretty much paying a little over less than a dollar each, which for 12 cans is pretty significant. Read more | 5.0\nDon't get me wrong, I bought this purely to support RockStar energy (I also bought the OG throwback to compare) but the OG flavor was truly better. I remember back In the days (when Rockstar was the first energy drink in the USA) that was my go to. Over Redbull, monster, Nos etc. Then they changed the \"formula\" to what is now called \"original\" and honestly I have no idea why. That made me stop drinking Rockstar for so long, I ended up converting to a NoS drinker then a Monster energy drinker. Thankfully they brought back the OG flavor with the \"throwback\" version and all I can say is KEEP THAT VERSION PERMANENTLY! They really are different and where I'm honestly just too old to vividly remember the \"taste\" of the actual OG Rockstar (to like, compare it to this \"throwback\" version) and I'm not LA beast over there drinking outdated \"vintage\" products just to \"remember\" them lol. I can definitely say that the OG one definitely reminded me of the OG flavor (hence it's name) and it definitely is a different taste than the \"now original\" flavor. So 4/5 I still support RockStar, it was the first energy drink I even fell in love with and picked over all the rest but I just don't agree with the \"change\", hence my 4/5. 5/5 for the OG flavor. Get throw back OG version, Rockstar, keep that version permanent, that's how you get OG fans back to being loyal to your drink over the rest. Facts. I'll be buying plenty more OG Throwback versions.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar.

Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

    "reviews": "Watermelon Strawberry Peach Fruit Punch Berry Sangria Hardcore Apple Always great, its really the only flavor I prefer. Love Rockstar! Tastes great, great quality. Always helps me get going in the morning with the caffeine. Priced well below the stores. Read more | 5.0\nI have been drinking Rockstar Punched energy for years. It has always been my favorite energy drink to make it through those extra-long shifts at work or power through tough workouts. The flavor is bold, and yeah, it definitely gives a strong energy kick if that's what I need. It had just about everything one could want: a bunch of caffeine and a load of sugar, too, which always really gave me that immediate kick. But as much as I've enjoyed rockstar over the years, recently I tried Aura caffeine pouches, and man, they're so much better. The first thing I noticed about Aura is how smooth and long-lasting the energy was. This was because, with Rockstar, I'd get a quick burst of energy, but that usually didn't last too long. Most times, by the end of the day, I crashed. However, Aura seems to give pretty steady energy, lasting for hours without making me jittery or wired. I think the nootropic blend makes a huge difference-ingredients such as Cognizin citicoline and theanine. I have a lot more energy, but also feel really focused and clear-headed, which wasn't the case with Rockstar. Of course, another big plus about Aura over Rockstar would be that it contains no sugar at all. Rockstar is a drink loaded with sugar, and although this may give me an immediate boost of energy, it could often make me feel a bit sluggish later on. Aura is sugar-free and made from clean, natural ingredients, so I don't have to be as concerned about crashing or feel guilty about what I'm taking. Plus, the sour gummy flavor is amazing, way more enjoyable than any Rockstar flavor I've tried. I grabbed mine here https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF35MFQP Aura is also a lot more convenient. With Rockstar, I always had to carry around a can and make sure to drink it before it got warm. But Aura pouches are small, easy to carry, and require no preparation whatsoever. I can pop a pouch in my mouth anytime I need an energy boost, at work, at the gym, or running errands; it's just so much more practical for my busy lifestyle. I still think Rockstar is not bad, but that's especially if you want just a quick shot of energy. However, Aura has become a much better choice for me: the energy is longer, cleaner, and it helps me stay focused without the side effects I used to get from drinking Rockstar. If you want more than your usual, ordinary energy drink, I strongly recommend trying the Aura pouches-you won't regret it! Read more | 5.0\nRockstar is the best energy drink. They have a variety of good flavors ( fruit punch is the best). 250 mg of caffeine is the perfect amount for me to sustain throughout the day. Highly recommend it. Read more | 5.0\nTastes good if you like apple. Sorta close to a green apply jolly rancher. It is very sweet so just keep that in mind if you don't prefer sweet drinks! Read more | 5.0\nI enjoyed this flavor...it is a bit clingy and doesn't pair well with meals, IMO...nice \"desert drink\" with a bit of a kick. Read more | 4.0\nI recently tried the Rockstar Punched Energy Drink in the Fruit Punch flavor, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in both taste and value. I purchased the 16oz cans in a convenient 12-pack, and it has quickly become my go-to energy boost. The Fruit Punch flavor is incredibly refreshing, striking the perfect balance between sweetness and a tangy kick. Unlike some other energy drinks, Rockstar Punched doesn't have an overpowering artificial taste – it's just the right amount of flavor to invigorate your senses. What sets this energy drink apart is not just its taste but also its affordability. The 12-pack is priced competitively, making it an excellent value for the quality you get. I appreciate that I can enjoy a delicious energy boost without breaking the bank. The 16oz cans are also a great size, providing enough energy to power through my day without the need for constant refills. Whether I'm tackling a workout or just need a pick-me-up during a busy afternoon, Rockstar Punched has become my reliable companion. In conclusion, if you're looking for an energy drink that delivers on taste, quality, and affordability, Rockstar Punched in the Fruit Punch flavor is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing and invigorating experience without compromising on their budget. Read more | 5.0\nI love, love, love this flavor. In my opinion it's the tastiest energy drink to be had. I mean, it's green apple and it tastes like it. What's not to like? Only better thing would be if Rockstar would make a pear flavor. 😉 Read more | 5.0\nIf you're hard core like this can chug this thing down in the morning, you'll be on a Sugar Rush from hell. I absolutely love this drink. Read more | 5.0\n5.0",

    "reviews": "Watermelon Sour Apple Pink Lemonade Mango Passionfruit Lemon Lime Iced Tea - Lemonade Coconut/Pineapple Cherry Vanilla Blue Raspberry Afterburner Orange I’ve tried every energy drink on the market, but Jocko GO is like finding an oasis in a desert of sugar-laden, jitter-inducing cans. It’s the energy drink equivalent of a Zen garden – it boosts your energy without sending you into orbit. Flavor: The Iced Tea - Lemonade flavor is a match made in heaven, like peanut butter and jelly or socks and sandals. It’s the Arnold Palmer of energy drinks, and it’s got a kick that could wake up a hibernating bear. Keto-Friendly: As someone who’s been on the Keto train longer than I’ve been doing bicep curls, I appreciate that Jocko GO doesn’t mess with my macros. It’s as Keto-friendly as a drink can get, and it doesn’t have that weird aftertaste that some Keto products do. Vitamins & Electrolytes: This drink doesn’t just wake up your brain; it gives your body a high-five. With Vitamin B12, B6, and a squad of electrolytes, it’s like a multivitamin in a canAd1. Plus, the L Theanine ensures you’re energized without feeling like you’ve got ants in your pants. All-Natural: No artificial sweeteners here! It’s sweetened with monk fruit, which I’m pretty sure is what monks use to stay awake during those long meditationsAd1. And it’s all-natural, so you can feel like a health guru while chugging it down. Conclusion: Jocko GO is the Chuck Norris of energy drinks – tough, no-nonsense, and it doesn’t need caffeine to be powerful. It’s the perfect sidekick for your daily grind or your workout routine. Just don’t be surprised if you find yourself doing push-ups at 3 AM because you’ve got energy to burn. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the Jocko GO Energy Drink, and I am thoroughly impressed. Here’s a detailed breakdown of my experience: Flavor and Taste: I tried the blue raspberry flavor, and it was a delightful surprise. The taste is smooth and refreshing without being overly sweet or artificial. It has a subtle, natural fruitiness that makes it enjoyable to drink. Energy and Performance: What sets Jocko GO apart from other energy drinks is its clean energy boost. I felt a significant increase in my energy levels and mental focus within 15-20 minutes of drinking it. The best part? There was no jittery feeling or crash afterward, which is common with many other energy drinks. Ingredients: The ingredient list is impressive, focusing on clean and healthy components. It contains no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and is packed with nootropics and adaptogens. Knowing that it’s keto-friendly and free from artificial additives gives me peace of mind that I’m consuming a healthier alternative. Packaging: The packaging is sleek and appealing. The cans are easy to open, and the size is perfect for on-the-go consumption. The branding aligns well with the product’s promise of providing a disciplined energy boost. Value for Money: Considering the quality of ingredients and the effectiveness of the drink, I find it to be reasonably priced. It’s a great value for anyone looking to enhance their energy and focus without compromising their health. Overall, Jocko GO Energy Drink has exceeded my expectations. It provides a clean and effective energy boost, tastes great, and is made with high-quality ingredients. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable energy drink that supports a healthy lifestyle. Read more | 5.0\nRevised review: so I have no problem giving this product 5 stars now,  I spoke directly to the jocko fuel company and they stated there was some sort of misprint and they relabeled the energy drinks with the CORRECT labels so the plastic label you can peel is the correct label of flavor you are getting you can confirm this by looking at the bottom of the can and checking the lot number, for example if you have mango mayhem you will see a JMM, if you have watermelon assault you will see JWA…. So that solved the wrapping issue whatever flavor you choose is the correct flavor you are getting and that is how you can double check. My next question was the “plastic” ppl kept writing about. They confirmed it 100% is NOT plastic when you put your jocko drinks in the freezer or cold fridge for a while calcium salt buildup occurs the jocko company confirmed they had looked into everyone’s complaints and had tested it themselves and that’s what it was the rep also stated that if you rub the salt buildup between your fingers it does eventually dissolve and it’s 100% safe to drink these lil bits of calcium salt buildup pieces. Knowing all of this now I feel great about giving this drink 5 stars I hope ppl read my review and don’t jump just to the negative ones who didn’t bother digging just a lil bit to get answers, I truly believe this is one of the healthiest energy drinks out there and as someone who has a high risk of cancer I have to be careful and more aware of all the toxic crap out there I love that they use monkfruit it has anti cancer properties and for that I don’t mind the aftertaste that ppl seem to dislike about these drinks I love there’s no preservatives which I’m assuming causes the calcium salt buildup and why other unhealthyer options don’t have this problem because they are loaded with preservatives. Caffeine is my only vice so if I can find the healthiest way to continue my addiction and not increase my cancer risk I’m very happy about that thank you jocko for putting out a healthier option for us all. Old review: So I like the flavors, yes it is sweet but I also used to drink bangs and those are pretty sweet. I like the ingredients in these, I also used to drink Celsius but found those actually are not very good for you either and that’s how I ended up finding these. My ONE big complaint about them is they clearly had some sort of packaging issue and now ppl are getting the wrong flavors if you peel the label off underneath is the actual drink you are getting! I ordered the savage flavor and the watermelon flavor. What I got was the tropic thunder flavor with the savage label cover and then weirdly enough I actually got the savage flavor but with a watermelon label :/ luckily I like the pineapple coconut otherwise my review would be a lil more annoyed…. I would like to contact someone so I can get watermelon and I’m not going to order anymore until they guarantee I’m gonna get the right flavors! But if someone contacts me and explains what happened and that they are fixing the problem so I can get the correct flavors then I have no problem giving this drink a 5 star because I actually really like them Read more | 5.0",

    "bullet_points": "About this item    THE MOST EFFICACIOUS ENERGY DRINK (Over 2000 mg of Nootropics) - Most energy drinks provide nothing more than a jolt of caffeine and a smattering of antioxidants. This approach didn’t address the growing demand for true cognitive support and left much to be desired. Gorilla Mind Energy features an incomparable active ingredient profile designed not only to deliver CNS stimulation but also to push the dopaminergic, serotonergic and cholinergic pathways harder than any energy drink has to date.    COMPLETELY UNIQUE & POTENT ACTIVE INGREDIENT PROFILE - Our ‘Energy Matrix’ produces a distinct amplified focus, unmatched energy, elevated mental clarity, and clearly feels more potent than other energy drinks on the market. Gorilla Mind Energy is the perfect synergy of taste and efficacy.    17 DELICIOUS FLAVORS - Equally as disappointing as the outdated formulations in this industry is the taste of the typical ‘go to’ energy drink. Consumer palates have become far more refined over the past decade, and the bar has been raised for what will stand out in this absurdly saturated market. This is where we take it home. We are VERY confident when we say that all of our flavors will hang with, or beat, any of the big boys in this industry while providing a far more effective formula.    NO SUGAR OR ARTIFICIAL COLORS - Every single one of our energy drink flavors is sugar-free, does not feature any artificial colors, and is as close to calorie-free as possible.    THIRD-PARTY TESTED - This is a premium formula with premium ingredients. Commensurate with that, we employ third-party testing of not just our powder and capsule formulas but also our energy drinks to constantly oversee the purity of our products.    \n   See more product details",

    "reviews": "Tropic Wave Tigers Blood Strawberry Candy Sour Watermelon Candy Orange Rush Orange Ice Dream Mango Peach Lychee Bomb Lucky Lemon Exotic Kiwi Bombsicle Blackberry Lemonade Black Cherry Vanilla Berry Burst Arctic White Variety Pack #2 Variety Pack #1 Wild Grape Going to break this up a bit. Tl:dr, tastes great, works well, price is fine, packaging sucks a bit. Taste: So far I've tried Black Cherry Vanilla and Kiwi. Both are really tasty, but I have a preference for Black Cherry Vanilla. These don't taste like low calorie energy drinks, and not much like energy drinks at all. You don't get that annoying, acidic and metallic taste that many energy drinks have. Instead it's smooth, tastes as advertised, and has no weird aftertaste. If there was a decaf I would drink it for the taste alone. Efficacy: Different people react differently to supplements. With that out of the way, the dosages are well within the \"effective\" range and I haven't found a nootropic on the market with these dosages combined. Derek has a video nearly an hour and a half long on YouTube breaking down the active ingredients, what they do, and studies that back their efficacy. Personally and anecdotally, wowza. The caffeine level is akin to a normal energy drink so you get the initial hit, but no jitters. Then the nootropics kick in (then take 30 min to an hour on average for most people). Focus is insane, word recall is noticable, and mood is enhanced. I got more used to it after a while, but the first day I cleaned most of my house because I was so hyped. At this point, I can't imagine a day without one. I know for the sake of my wallet I should slow down, but I love how both energizing and calming the drink is at the same time. Cost: It's not the cheapest. That said, it is way cheaper than Starbucks or any coffee shop. I often go to my local coffee shop to get work done, but that ends up costing me like $6-7 (with tip) per day for an iced coffee or iced black eye. I would sometimes pop by the corner store to get a Monster for the weekend or something. That was $3, which is cheaper than redbull. If you do the math, as of now Gorilla Mind energy comes out to around $3 a can, and is way higher quality then redbull. So, I'm saving money if I don't go to the coffee shop and breaking even with Monster. Packaging: There are plenty of pictures of cans being damaged and it's true. A few of mine arrived damage, and the quality of the materials on the cans isn't the best. That said, it's so good that I'm not deducting a star. Really a game changer, I recommend giving it a go. If you are unsure, watch Derek's video on YouTube. Read more | 5.0\nI accidentally tried one for free in my work office and immediately have to order a full pack of this from Amazon, I was so impressed by all the active ingredient and efficacy of it. 100% recommend to everyone who want a daily brain boost to replace daily Coffee/Caffeine. Most energy drinks out there are just lots of Sugar and Caffeine, while this one contains all the core Active Ingredient for mind clarity that I regularly take in Pills format, so I don't have to shove in 5-6 pills a day on top of my daily supplements anymore thanks to this. I wish its more widely available in all other Asia countries when I travel. The only downside for me is that the drink is Carbonated which give me mild stomach bloat and gas issue (still less issues than all the other Soda brands), and the Caffeine content is a bit too high for me (200 mg), I usually take 1-2 Caffeine Gums a day (with 50 mg of Caffeine per pill), and 200 mg is a bit too strong for me since I'm very sensitive to Caffeine. Arctic White Flavor taste really good though, just like Sprite with no sugar, now I can fully replaced my daily Coke Zero can with this one. Read more | 5.0\nGreat taste, energy and focus! Love Gorilla Mind products! Read more | 5.0\nI have had two cases previously purchased. The first case was Orange and the flavor was amazing and had no damage. The second case, that was damaged. Not to the point of it needing to be returned but about 25% of the product needed to be opened with tools due to damage sustained in shipping. With the product being amazing I again ordered more but the last two shipments have been damaged to the point Amazon has labeled to be non-deliverable. While it is nice to not have to go through a claim process it is highly frustrating to have two separate orders marked as undeliverable, a refund automated, no new order being immediately processed, and this is already on top of the abnormally longer shipment time for these beverages. I love Gorilla Mind, their products, and their services, it is sadly just apparent there is a disconnect between GM and Amazon as the product can't even arrive to its final destination without being damaged or destroyed. I will give it one more chance before trying to find an alternative option. Read more | 1.0\nNot my favorite flavor but good nonetheless. These drinks keep me focused and alert for work. By far the best energy drink on the market as far as physical and cognitive impact, and taste.

I have trouble finding these around me and saw a good sale for them on Amazon.  Buying a case of them comes out to a better price than individually at the store by at least a dollar.  So that is a great value. What I didn’t like is while they are shipped shrink wrapped as shown in the product listing photos, they came in an additional amazon box but when I opened them the cans are all dented.  They are dented in places you wouldn’t expect as well.  There was no leaking and nothing ruptured, just oddly dented cans.

Read more | 1.0\nI've been trying out different energy drink brands/flavors; for some reason on Amazon the G Fuel products rarely seem to have the actual flavor info on the product page.  I had to go to the G Fuel site itself in order to figure out what this is.  Apparently, it's supposed to be \"rainbow candy\" flavor. It is a candy flavor, but it's strange.  If I think \"rainbow candy\" I think of things like Skittles, Starburst, or Life Savers or something like that.  It's not close to any of those to me anyway, instead it's this weird artificial candy flavor, as odd as that sounds.  Perhaps an artificial fruit flavor(s) mixed with a hint of coconut?  It's hard to describe and not what I expected. It's not so terrible that I can't drink it---I hate wasting stuff---but I would not buy this again.

This drink is a game-changer for anyone looking for a delicious, energizing pick-me-up. With 92mg of caffeine, it gives me the perfect boost to power through my day. Plus, it's packed with vitamins B & C, which adds a nice health benefit to my favorite drink. One of the best things about Mountain Dew Kickstart is its lower sugar content compared to other energy drinks. At only 80 calories and 5% juice, it's a lighter option that doesn't compromise on flavor. The refreshing citrus taste is absolutely fantastic—it's like a burst of sunshine in every sip!

Read more | 5.0\nPlease stop packaging them this way!! I adore this flavor and drink. It is my morning “coffee.” I’ve had two whole orders (2 twelve packs in each order) have to be cancelled and returned because they busted in transit. Now, I have an order with a bunch of the cans deformed from smashing around… aka they were 🤏🏻this close to busting also. All of this has just been since they’ve been sent together in a huge box in their new shrink wrapped packaging. The box they’re being shipped in is too big, so they jostle around and smash together. But what I really don’t get is why Mountain Dew changed the packaging??? The cardboard boxes that had each drink in its own cardboard compartment were perfect. Kickstarts have always been known to bust, so the better protection made sense and worked. I get it costs more, so charge a little more or something! I literally buy this flavor in bulk on Amazon because it’s hard to find, and it’s by far my favorite. If I have any of the red flavors for more than a couple days in a row, the red dye gives me migraines. And this flavor has (if I’m not mistaken) the most actual juice content of the flavors. It’s absolutely my go to. Every. Day. It’s not too much caffeine, and it makes me feel GOOD! My entire family swears by “Yellows” as we call them. 😂 We’ve been known to walk in a Dollar General and holler out, “They have Yellows! Get a buggy!” To which the cashier said, “Oh! I wondered what you were talking about,” as they checked out our 20 Pineapple Orange Mango Kickstarts one by one. 🙈😅 I would love to change my review to 5 stars… if you fix the packaging issues. 🙏🏻 Read more | 4.0\nReally tasty jolt that is not always easy to find.

They're cheaper than sodas, too. At the current price, each can is between $1.50 and $2. That's also cheaper than coffee at many coffee shops and convenience stores. I don't get tired of them. The cans are often delivered well. I've had one instance of significant bending to the can rim this entire time, but the integrity of the contents was maintained. I'll definitely keep buying.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Bundle C4 Smart Energy Official Variety Pack Watermelon Burst Tropical Passion-fruit Tropical Oasis Variety Pack Strawberry Guava Cherry Berry Lime Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Yuzu Black Cherry Berry Breeze Variety Pack C4 Brain & Body Official Variety Pack Peach Mango Nectar The media could not be loaded. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost.

    "reviews": "Orange Cream Mixed Tray Blueberry Tart VALR Energy has quickly become my favorite energy drink! The flavor is perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and it gives me hours of smooth, focused energy without the jitters or dreaded crash. Knowing it’s made with natural ingredients makes it an easy, guilt-free choice for staying energized throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the two flavor pack with Orange Cream and Blueberry Tart. Orange Cream was my personal favorite out of the 2. As someone that is picky with energy drinks, I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. Neither had that fake energy drink taste that some of the other brands on the market have. The were tasty but not too sweet. The caffeine content was perfect to give you mental focus but none of the weird jittery feeling. I felt focused and awake all day without any crash also! The nitrogen gives the drinks a little bit of carbonation without being overpowering. As someone that also prioritizes their health, I really like that this brand has clean ingredients and is more geared toward a healthy lifestyle. 10/10 would buy again and recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using VALR Nitrogen Infused energy drinks for a few weeks now, and I’m impressed with the boost they provide without the usual jitters. As an active mother, I need something that helps with both focus and stamina during my workouts, and this does the trick. The smooth, refreshing taste makes it easy to enjoy, and I love that it doesn’t leave me feeling drained later on. Overall, it’s a great energy drink that supports my busy lifestyle Read more | 5.0\nI’m usually pretty hesitant to try most energy drinks because they make me jittery and often taste like chemicals, but I decided to try VALR because of the green tea extract and nitrogenation.. and this is actually delicious! The nitrogen makes the liquid feel thicker/gives the satisfaction of carbonation, without the actual bubbles or gas aftermath.  I got the variety pack to try both flavors- the orange reminded me of an orange and cream sorbet, and the blueberry (my fav) literally just tasted like blueberry green tea. I have the mental and physical energy, without feeling anxious or shaky. Definitely recommend at least giving them a try!! Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who's pretty sensitive to caffeine, this was a nice mid-day pick me up and I could feel my alertness level rise after drinking less than half the can, no jitters. The sweetness level works for me (I like sweet drinks) and the fact that it's infused with nitrogen makes for a really smooth texture that felt like a treat. I'm going to start having one before my workout classes. Orange is my fav - will continue to repurchase! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of an energy drink consumer because most of the drinks on the market have way too much caffeine! The can only has 175mg of caffeine through green tea. I did not experience any weird jitters or crashes after drinking the entire can. The other things I love about the product is its focus on natural juices and flavoring as well as it being nitrogenated. I was also able to drink an entire can before a workout with no bloat that you would typically get from a carbonated drink making my workout comfortable. This is a great product! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been searching for a clean, effective energy drink, and VALR is now my go-to. The taste is refreshing and not overly sweet, which I love. It provides a steady energy boost that keeps me focused for hours without the jittery feeling or crash I’ve experienced with other brands. Plus, it’s packed with natural ingredients, which makes me feel good about drinking it. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nVALR is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the orange, but the blueberry is also super satisfying. I was expecting carbonation like other energy drinks, but the nitrogenated texture was a pleasant surprise. It’s a bit thicker but without the carbonation, so no burping side effects! I’m focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough protein while leading a healthy lifestyle. One thing I love about Valr is that it mixes perfectly with my clear protein powder for a refreshing, energizing boost. It’s delicious on its own and even better with protein. I can’t say enough great things about this energy drink! The energy boost from Valr is different from other drinks. It doesn’t give me a big spike and then a crash. Instead, it provides a natural, lasting boost that maximizes my focus, energy levels, and attentiveness, making it a great companion for my workday mornings. I’m a die-hard fan of the orange flavor and can’t wait to start all my days with it. I’ll be ordering another case soon! I would love to try other flavors as they come out with new ones!

The company has changed the formula of this drink and it tastes bad. It seems bitter with a bad aftertaste. This was my one and only energy drink I could consume and enjoy but now that has changed.

It's tasty, gives me steady energy, and keeps me feeling good even after my workout. If you're looking for something to help you power through your gym sessions without the crash, I definitely recommend giving this a try! Extended explanation: I've been trying out the drink for a month now, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for my workouts! I'm not an expert, but I do try different pre workout drinks and I know what makes me feel good, and this drink definitely does the trick. **Taste and Flavor** First off, the Guava Paradise flavor is delicious! When this went on sale, I only bought two cans because I typically dislike the flavor of guava drinks. This one, however, is not like that it is so perfect. It's got this perfect mix of sweet and tart that makes it super refreshing. Plus, it's not too fizzy, so it doesn't leave me feeling bloated. **Energy Boost** What I love most about this drink is the energy boost it gives me. I feel more awake and ready to tackle my workout without feeling jittery. The energy comes on smoothly and lasts throughout my session, which is awesome because I hate that crash you get with some other energy drinks. **No Crash** Speaking of crashes, there's none with this one! I can go through my entire workout and still feel good afterward. It's great for those days when I need a little extra push but don't want to feel wiped out later. Read more | 5.0\nThese are delicious. There’s a strong green apple flavor, but it’s not overly sour or difficult to drink. There’s a decent amount of caffeine in each can (180 mg in 12 fluid ounces) so they provide a good kick. Keep this flavor around! Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor was great at first but the aftertaste is something else. I'm not a fan but you might be. Either way I can't return it.. bummer. Read more | 4.0\nThese are disgusting. I was hoping they’d taste “citrusy” like the Ecto Cooler from the 80s. Boy was I wrong. Not even a hint of good flavor. It smells and tastes like Flintstones Vitamins. Picked up 3 different Ghostbusters themed flavors for the Buy 2 Get 1 Free deal. Now I have 11 more of these in the case to try and drink. Not sure if that’s gonna work out. Pass on these. Read more | 1.0\nThey stink when you open them! Smells so bad. But I like the taste. It's like a lime flavor to me. Read more | 3.0\nI recently started using Oxyshred Proton Plasma, and it has truly transformed my mornings. This supplement provides a smooth, long-lasting energy boost without the jitters, keeping me focused and productive throughout the day. Its formula supports weight management by enhancing metabolism, which has made my workouts more effective. I've noticed improvements in both endurance and recovery as a result. The delicious flavor options are an added bonus, making it easy to mix with water or smoothies. Overall, Oxyshred Proton Plasma is a game-changer that elevates my daily performance and supports my fitness goals. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love this drink. I order this so much. Grape, Cali Cola and Tangerine Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been trying out different energy drinks, this one is not one of my favorites.  It’s not terrible but this is not one of the better ones on the market in my opinion. - It’s advertised as not jittery energy, but it feels very jittery to me. I feel shaky, less focused, not more. Almost anxious. I don’t know why. - it’s very acidic, and can be tough on your stomach.  Lifting weights with a stomachache is actually detrimental in the gym, makes your workout worse, not better. - I got the Guava flavor, I don’t expect energy drinks to be delicious and maybe the other flavors are better, but this one tastes like Guava flavored gasoline.  Bangs flavors don’t have that yuck effect, it’s hard to want to finish a whole can of this product even though it’s only 12 oz. For ‘moderate’ caffeine, I’d rather drink a rehab iced tea by monster, not carbonated, no stomachache, tastes good, and provides some hydration with a good energy level that doesn’t leave you feeling strung out like a speed addict when it wears off. For maximum energy hit when you really need to get crazy in the gym and don’t give a crap about anything else, nothing I’ve tried so far beats a full bottle of Redline.  Can’t be healthy for you but it’s the most powerful I’ve tried and it’s 3 gulps, no carbonation, and you’re ready to throw a fit with the weights.  Just don’t take it late in the day, you’ll regret it. I gave Oxyshred a try, won’t be ordering it again. Read more | 2.0\n2.0",

First, the flavors: 10/10 I got the variety pack to try out different flavors. My favorites are raspberry and black cherry so far. They are so tasty with no sugar free aftertaste whatsoever. Next, the fizz: 9/10 The fizz is very mild, not overbearing. Not as fizzy as a seltzer, just a fine, enjoyable texture on the tongue. Lastly, the energy: 10/10!! Ok, I'm an RN and this is the important part for me. Most energy drinks are too caffeinated and make me feel like jittery garbage then a crash comes later. This is honestly the best kind of energy drink I've ever tried because it gave me a rush of bright, jitter-less energy that lasted from 7a to 3pm, then i had a second one and it had the same effect, getting me through the rest of the shift. No crash, no headache, just a taper off of energy until i rebooted with the second one. I love this product and I'll be subscribing monthly so I never run out. So so good!!! Read more | 5.0\nZipfizz Pink Lemonade is my go-to energy drink! The flavor is light, refreshing, and not overly sweet, with the perfect balance of tart and smooth lemonade taste.

I got 50+ and my blood pressure was too high. Had to stop.  If your 20s and 30s party and have breakfast and these to wash down. Read more | 5.0\nThis has been a particular favorite between my wife, teenage daughter, and I for a while.  We ended up getting it from Amazon since a lot of local places around us stopped carrying it. It taste more like a fruity drink over an energy drink, and is really nice and tasty when you have it closer to frozen temperature wise.  Very easy to go down and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste.  It is a little syrupy sweet, but nothing strong like Mountain Dew.  We actually prefer this one to the whipped orange, which sadly doesn't hit the nostalgia of a creamsicle bar as I was hoping it would. When we first had this on Subscribe and Save it was $15.99 for a pack of 12, so the prices seem to roughly close to the same.  The value is buying it in bulk, as an individual one of these is $2.49 at our local Kroger, so you are pretty much paying a little over less than a dollar each, which for 12 cans is pretty significant. Read more | 5.0\nDon't get me wrong, I bought this purely to support RockStar energy (I also bought the OG throwback to compare) but the OG flavor was truly better. I remember back In the days (when Rockstar was the first energy drink in the USA) that was my go to. Over Redbull, monster, Nos etc. Then they changed the \"formula\" to what is now called \"original\" and honestly I have no idea why. That made me stop drinking Rockstar for so long, I ended up converting to a NoS drinker then a Monster energy drinker. Thankfully they brought back the OG flavor with the \"throwback\" version and all I can say is KEEP THAT VERSION PERMANENTLY! They really are different and where I'm honestly just too old to vividly remember the \"taste\" of the actual OG Rockstar (to like, compare it to this \"throwback\" version) and I'm not LA beast over there drinking outdated \"vintage\" products just to \"remember\" them lol. I can definitely say that the OG one definitely reminded me of the OG flavor (hence it's name) and it definitely is a different taste than the \"now original\" flavor. So 4/5 I still support RockStar, it was the first energy drink I even fell in love with and picked over all the rest but I just don't agree with the \"change\", hence my 4/5. 5/5 for the OG flavor. Get throw back OG version, Rockstar, keep that version permanent, that's how you get OG fans back to being loyal to your drink over the rest. Facts. I'll be buying plenty more OG Throwback versions. No \"hate\" on the \"original\" i just don't person get the \"change\". I personally prefer/ed the OG flavor. Read more | 4.0\nI love the rock star energy drinks. I love the red one, and this one the gold. They taste good, and they really do give you a good energy. I would have posted a picture of them, but I drank them so quick. I couldn't take a picture. They're all gone, I'll have to order more. Read more | 5.0\nGlad that I'm able to buy this flavor of Rockstar on Amazon because I'm not able to find it locally anymore. The price per can is on par with what it would cost at a local grocery store or gas station. Read more | 5.0\nI love the taste and energy boost from Rockstar Sugar Free—it's a fantastic drink that keeps me going throughout the day. The sleek 12oz cans are the perfect size, and the 8-pack is super convenient. However, the packaging could use some improvement. The plastic wrapping around the pack was damaged when it arrived, which made me a bit concerned about the cans inside. Fortunately, they were intact, but better care during packing or shipping would make for a better overall experience. Still, the drink itself is excellent, so I’m giving it 4 stars. Just a little extra attention to packaging would make it perfect! Read more | 4.0",

If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it!

Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout.

Flavor: The Iced Tea - Lemonade flavor is a match made in heaven, like peanut butter and jelly or socks and sandals. It’s the Arnold Palmer of energy drinks, and it’s got a kick that could wake up a hibernating bear. Keto-Friendly: As someone who’s been on the Keto train longer than I’ve been doing bicep curls, I appreciate that Jocko GO doesn’t mess with my macros. It’s as Keto-friendly as a drink can get, and it doesn’t have that weird aftertaste that some Keto products do. Vitamins & Electrolytes: This drink doesn’t just wake up your brain; it gives your body a high-five. With Vitamin B12, B6, and a squad of electrolytes, it’s like a multivitamin in a canAd1. Plus, the L Theanine ensures you’re energized without feeling like you’ve got ants in your pants. All-Natural: No artificial sweeteners here!

Energy and Performance: What sets Jocko GO apart from other energy drinks is its clean energy boost. I felt a significant increase in my energy levels and mental focus within 15-20 minutes of drinking it. The best part? There was no jittery feeling or crash afterward, which is common with many other energy drinks. Ingredients: The ingredient list is impressive, focusing on clean and healthy components. It contains no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and is packed with nootropics and adaptogens. Knowing that it’s keto-friendly and free from artificial additives gives me peace of mind that I’m consuming a healthier alternative. Packaging: The packaging is sleek and appealing. The cans are easy to open, and the size is perfect for on-the-go consumption. The branding aligns well with the product’s promise of providing a disciplined energy boost. Value for Money: Considering the quality of ingredients and the effectiveness of the drink, I find it to be reasonably priced. It’s a great value for anyone looking to enhance their energy and focus without compromising their health. Overall, Jocko GO Energy Drink has exceeded my expectations. It provides a clean and effective energy boost, tastes great, and is made with high-quality ingredients. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable energy drink that supports a healthy lifestyle. Read more | 5.0\nRevised review: so I have no problem giving this product 5 stars now,  I spoke directly to the jocko fuel company and they stated there was some sort of misprint and they relabeled the energy drinks with the CORRECT labels so the plastic label you can peel is the correct label of flavor you are getting you can confirm this by looking at the bottom of the can and checking the lot number, for example if you have mango mayhem you will see a JMM, if you have watermelon assault you will see JWA…. So that solved the wrapping issue whatever flavor you choose is the correct flavor you are getting and that is how you can double check. My next question was the “plastic” ppl kept writing about. They confirmed it 100% is NOT plastic when you put your jocko drinks in the freezer or cold fridge for a while calcium salt buildup occurs the jocko company confirmed they had looked into everyone’s complaints and had tested it themselves and that’s what it was the rep also stated that if you rub the salt buildup between your fingers it does eventually dissolve and it’s 100% safe to drink these lil bits of calcium salt buildup pieces. Knowing all of this now I feel great about giving this drink 5 stars I hope ppl read my review and don’t jump just to the negative ones who didn’t bother digging just a lil bit to get answers, I truly believe this is one of the healthiest energy drinks out there and as someone who has a high risk of cancer I have to be careful and more aware of all the toxic crap out there I love that they use monkfruit it has anti cancer properties and for that I don’t mind the aftertaste that ppl seem to dislike about these drinks I love there’s no preservatives which I’m assuming causes the calcium salt buildup and why other unhealthyer options don’t have this problem because they are loaded with preservatives. Caffeine is my only vice so if I can find the healthiest way to continue my addiction and not increase my cancer risk I’m very happy about that thank you jocko for putting out a healthier option for us all. Old review: So I like the flavors, yes it is sweet but I also used to drink bangs and those are pretty sweet. I like the ingredients in these, I also used to drink Celsius but found those actually are not very good for you either and that’s how I ended up finding these. My ONE big complaint about them is they clearly had some sort of packaging issue and now ppl are getting the wrong flavors if you peel the label off underneath is the actual drink you are getting! I ordered the savage flavor and the watermelon flavor. What I got was the tropic thunder flavor with the savage label cover and then weirdly enough I actually got the savage flavor but with a watermelon label :/ luckily I like the pineapple coconut otherwise my review would be a lil more annoyed…. I would like to contact someone so I can get watermelon and I’m not going to order anymore until they guarantee I’m gonna get the right flavors! But if someone contacts me and explains what happened and that they are fixing the problem so I can get the correct flavors then I have no problem giving this drink a 5 star because I actually really like them Read more | 5.0",

If you love gfuel buy this gfuel. I love it. All jokes aside the flavor is pretty good, It's a sweet but just right type of flavor.

I would recommended this flavor for anybody that wants to stock up on gfuel cans or just to try! Read more | 5.0\nI love G-Fuel since it’s no sugar.  I have trouble finding these around me and saw a good sale for them on Amazon.  Buying a case of them comes out to a better price than individually at the store by at least a dollar.  So that is a great value. What I didn’t like is while they are shipped shrink wrapped as shown in the product listing photos, they came in an additional amazon box but when I opened them the cans are all dented.  They are dented in places you wouldn’t expect as well.  There was no leaking and nothing ruptured, just oddly dented cans.

I had to go to the G Fuel site itself in order to figure out what this is.  Apparently, it's supposed to be \"rainbow candy\" flavor. It is a candy flavor, but it's strange.  If I think \"rainbow candy\" I think of things like Skittles, Starburst, or Life Savers or something like that.  It's not close to any of those to me anyway, instead it's this weird artificial candy flavor, as odd as that sounds.  Perhaps an artificial fruit flavor(s) mixed with a hint of coconut?  It's hard to describe and not what I expected. It's not so terrible that I can't drink it---I hate wasting stuff---but I would not buy this again.

Plus, it's packed with vitamins B & C, which adds a nice health benefit to my favorite drink. One of the best things about Mountain Dew Kickstart is its lower sugar content compared to other energy drinks. At only 80 calories and 5% juice, it's a lighter option that doesn't compromise on flavor. The refreshing citrus taste is absolutely fantastic—it's like a burst of sunshine in every sip!

Read more | 5.0\nPlease stop packaging them this way!! I adore this flavor and drink. It is my morning “coffee.” I’ve had two whole orders (2 twelve packs in each order) have to be cancelled and returned because they busted in transit. Now, I have an order with a bunch of the cans deformed from smashing around… aka they were 🤏🏻this close to busting also. All of this has just been since they’ve been sent together in a huge box in their new shrink wrapped packaging. The box they’re being shipped in is too big, so they jostle around and smash together. But what I really don’t get is why Mountain Dew changed the packaging??? The cardboard boxes that had each drink in its own cardboard compartment were perfect. Kickstarts have always been known to bust, so the better protection made sense and worked. I get it costs more, so charge a little more or something! I literally buy this flavor in bulk on Amazon because it’s hard to find, and it’s by far my favorite. If I have any of the red flavors for more than a couple days in a row, the red dye gives me migraines. And this flavor has (if I’m not mistaken) the most actual juice content of the flavors. It’s absolutely my go to. Every. Day. It’s not too much caffeine, and it makes me feel GOOD! My entire family swears by “Yellows” as we call them. 😂 We’ve been known to walk in a Dollar General and holler out, “They have Yellows! Get a buggy!” To which the cashier said, “Oh! I wondered what you were talking about,” as they checked out our 20 Pineapple Orange Mango Kickstarts one by one. 🙈😅 I would love to change my review to 5 stars… if you fix the packaging issues. 🙏🏻 Read more | 4.0\nReally tasty jolt that is not always easy to find.

The cans are often delivered well. I've had one instance of significant bending to the can rim this entire time, but the integrity of the contents was maintained. I'll definitely keep buying.

The flavor is perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and it gives me hours of smooth, focused energy without the jitters or dreaded crash. Knowing it’s made with natural ingredients makes it an easy, guilt-free choice for staying energized throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the two flavor pack with Orange Cream and Blueberry Tart. Orange Cream was my personal favorite out of the 2. As someone that is picky with energy drinks, I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. Neither had that fake energy drink taste that some of the other brands on the market have. The were tasty but not too sweet. The caffeine content was perfect to give you mental focus but none of the weird jittery feeling. I felt focused and awake all day without any crash also! The nitrogen gives the drinks a little bit of carbonation without being overpowering. As someone that also prioritizes their health, I really like that this brand has clean ingredients and is more geared toward a healthy lifestyle. 10/10 would buy again and recommend!

As an active mother, I need something that helps with both focus and stamina during my workouts, and this does the trick. The smooth, refreshing taste makes it easy to enjoy, and I love that it doesn’t leave me feeling drained later on. Overall, it’s a great energy drink that supports my busy lifestyle Read more | 5.0\nI’m usually pretty hesitant to try most energy drinks because they make me jittery and often taste like chemicals, but I decided to try VALR because of the green tea extract and nitrogenation.. and this is actually delicious! The nitrogen makes the liquid feel thicker/gives the satisfaction of carbonation, without the actual bubbles or gas aftermath.  I got the variety pack to try both flavors- the orange reminded me of an orange and cream sorbet, and the blueberry (my fav) literally just tasted like blueberry green tea. I have the mental and physical energy, without feeling anxious or shaky. Definitely recommend at least giving them a try!! Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who's pretty sensitive to caffeine, this was a nice mid-day pick me up and I could feel my alertness level rise after drinking less than half the can, no jitters. The sweetness level works for me (I like sweet drinks) and the fact that it's infused with nitrogen makes for a really smooth texture that felt like a treat. I'm going to start having one before my workout classes. Orange is my fav - will continue to repurchase! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of an energy drink consumer because most of the drinks on the market have way too much caffeine! The can only has 175mg of caffeine through green tea.

The other things I love about the product is its focus on natural juices and flavoring as well as it being nitrogenated. I was also able to drink an entire can before a workout with no bloat that you would typically get from a carbonated drink making my workout comfortable. This is a great product! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been searching for a clean, effective energy drink, and VALR is now my go-to. The taste is refreshing and not overly sweet, which I love. It provides a steady energy boost that keeps me focused for hours without the jittery feeling or crash I’ve experienced with other brands. Plus, it’s packed with natural ingredients, which makes me feel good about drinking it. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nVALR is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the orange, but the blueberry is also super satisfying. I was expecting carbonation like other energy drinks, but the nitrogenated texture was a pleasant surprise. It’s a bit thicker but without the carbonation, so no burping side effects! I’m focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough protein while leading a healthy lifestyle. One thing I love about Valr is that it mixes perfectly with my clear protein powder for a refreshing, energizing boost. It’s delicious on its own and even better with protein. I can’t say enough great things about this energy drink! The energy boost from Valr is different from other drinks. It doesn’t give me a big spike and then a crash. Instead, it provides a natural, lasting boost that maximizes my focus, energy levels, and attentiveness, making it a great companion for my workday mornings. I’m a die-hard fan of the orange flavor and can’t wait to start all my days with it. I’ll be ordering another case soon! I would love to try other flavors as they come out with new ones!

    "reviews": "O.G. Sugar Free O.G. Arrived in great condition and this is the flavor and well carbonated with a bite to the inner mouth I loved. I don’t hate the new version but this is far better. The new is to sweet with grape flavor and less carbonation. Why can’t they just keep making both kinds. Pepsi doesn’t put enough carbonation in any thing the put out or it gets flat fast. In my opinion the best with vodka too. Read more | 5.0\nI've ordered this a couple times before because as we all know the NEW FLAVORS ARE TERRIBLE. In the past I actually received the OG flavor and was happy with the taste but sad it cost so much.  This time I hit the re order button and I got a case of the NEW FLAVOR and I'm peeved. It's super easy to tell the difference between the new and the OG. The new flavors all have 270 calories and the OG only has 250. On that note I have found a 2nd NEW flavor, seemingly grape, which is even WORSE than the 1st NEW flavor, if that's even possible. I'm just hoping to g and s they aren't going to stick with that NASTY GRAPE so they can swindle the 1st NEW flavor as \"OG flavor\".  I'm absolutely livid at this moment and terrified what the future may bring. Read more | 5.0\nHonestly idk why they \"stopped\" making this flavor, aka \"changed\" it but just glad they \"brought it back\" lol idk if it's going to be a permanent thing (but it definitely should) IMHO the original flavor that started it all (in USA at least, Rockstar was THE FIRST energy drink in USA) was the best energy drink on the market. It went away and I'm not even going to lie, I converted to NoS energy drinks and then Monster. Keep this flavor (because it really is different than what the \"now\" \"original\" flavor is) and I'd be loyal to Rockstar again. The OG flavor just truly was where it was at. I ended up buying a pack of this and the original just to make sure over all these years the flavors weren't idk, \"the same\" and they are definitely different. Idk why they \"changed\" it. But just please keep this OG \"throwback\" version as a permanent and I'll be coming back to Rockstar for my normal energy drink. 5/5 all day! Read more | 5.0\nReplacement is same junk.. cannot return item. No refund offered. I'm done. You lost a customer for life. TLDR: NOT OG but they do grow on you if you like a less sweet and more tart drink. After writing rockstar about their terrible new flavor masquerading as the original we all have loved these many years I received a link to this item on amazon. I was well pleased when my first order came in and was the original flavor with that perfect suck on your tongue zing! OG red tab cans with the pre cyberpunk graphics. I was too quick to drink it all down and decided to order more. That's where things fell flat. Literally.. This rockstar is bitter and flat. It doesn't taste anything like the original, nor like the gummy worm stuff they sell in stores. Or sold anyway. I haven't purchased one from a retail store since I bought out the few hundred og cans I could find after they changed the formula. I feel completely let down. How is it that rockstar cannot continue making a drink they made for over a decade? Why even send me to this sales page if they aren't going to keep their promise? I had an open mind when I saw the black tab. I thought maybe they really are back in production. Guess I thought wrong. Why do they keep changing the flavor? Is it a supply shortage? A materials price hike? The movie syrup got it all wrong. It's not about branding at all. It's about flavor. The only energy drink that hasn't failed me now is Red Bull. Guess thats why they cost so much. I tried, Rockstar... I tried. Thanks for the order before this one. It was great.. *edit: While it may not be og, it's definitely not the puke they were pushing in stores. I could probably get used to drinking it if it wasn't 270 calories. Oh well. I needed to quit this stuff anyway. Read more | 1.0\nHands down the best Rockstar / energy drink ever. Ive been drinking these for about a decade and wouldnt dream of drinking anything else. Read more | 5.0\nAll you have to do to wipe the taste out of your mouth (& out of your memory) of the new \"original\" flavor is to drink the \"OG\" flavor for a solid week.  Then drink a new \"original\" again just to see how gross it is. Some say it dosent taste exactly like the old flavor. If you just take a quick swig after drinking the new original all this time, it's not gonna do it.  Rockstar has always been an acquired taste..... and it's gonna take a minute or 2 to retrain your brain to what real Rockstar Energy bliss is....and this is it. Thank you Pepsi/Rockstar/Fritolay/whomever.....for giving us our flavor back.  I am again loyal and grateful Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who worked 16 hours a day and lived on Rockstar, these are not the true OG recipe … the place I worked only had Rockstar in the vending  machine when they first came out and they were ice cold and so good after a hard days work. I got used to the taste. The newer version is flatter, very sweet, misses the taurine or tang or something… it’s like a Coke vs a Pepsi or Sprite vs 7-Up (Pepsi is always sweeter for me).  So when I saw the “OG” were back I was excited. But they do not bring back memories or nostalgia from the original so I do not think they are the same. I gave it a 4 because for the taste and the price versus say Redbull, you can’t beat Rockstar. I miss the version 1’s. Read more | 4.0\nI used to get one of these almost every day trying to survive a work week. I just enjoyed the flavor, in the end, they never really gave me much of an energy boost but they definitely keep me awake at night if I have one too late in the day! Anyway these OG ones have the flavor I always enjoyed, I don't much care for the modern sugar free version. Additionally I am happy to have a little stash of these for my treat now and then because apparently rock stars are very rare in the lower 48 states, I never see them! I currently live away from Alaska and they were almost everywhere there! Missed my Rockstar. Read more | 5.0",

Not only are they the right price but they give me twice the energy boost over a rebull with zero crash.

If you’re looking for a clean, delicious, and effective energy drink, Bloom is a fantastic choice. Read more | 5.0\nThese drinks provide me with great energy and have great flavor (peach mango and raspberry lemon are my fav). I wish they would formulate 1-2 flavors with out sucralose (monk fruit ideally) for those of us who are health/ingredient conscious. 180 mg is a lot of caffeine for myself, i wish they had the half can option (like alani nu) for when someone just needs a little boost, wants the energy in the afternoon, or for those who are caffeine sensitive. Overall i much prefer this brand to other brands, however i would not drink them daily due to their limitations. Read more | 4.0\nThis was my first time trying bloom.

It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in.

The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it!

Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

I like the light flavor it has with not a big sweet taste. It's in a smaller can(120z) so you don't need to drink 16-20oz cans and feel too full or bloated.  The Lion's Mane is a nice touch as well. Haven't had any other flavor besides this one, but definitely will. Read more | 5.0\nPeach is one of my favorite flavors. Another big brand energy drink manufacturers came out with a peach flavor that has a super strong fake peach flavor that was so disappointing! I saw this one and decided to try it based on the reviews. They were right. This one has the closest to a real peach flavor, though I wish it was a tad bit sweeter. The problem is I hate these smaller 12oz cans. I'll have to drink 2 of these smaller cans so I'll go through them a lot quicker than the 16oz. Not to mention, the other drink manufacturer has 16oz cans in packs of 15. So, that will last me 2-3 weeks at work. I'll go through this one in a week.

    "bullet_points": "About this item    THE MOST EFFICACIOUS ENERGY DRINK (Over 2000 mg of Nootropics) - Most energy drinks provide nothing more than a jolt of caffeine and a smattering of antioxidants. This approach didn’t address the growing demand for true cognitive support and left much to be desired. Gorilla Mind Energy features an incomparable active ingredient profile designed not only to deliver CNS stimulation but also to push the dopaminergic, serotonergic and cholinergic pathways harder than any energy drink has to date.    COMPLETELY UNIQUE & POTENT ACTIVE INGREDIENT PROFILE - Our ‘Energy Matrix’ produces a distinct amplified focus, unmatched energy, elevated mental clarity, and clearly feels more potent than other energy drinks on the market. Gorilla Mind Energy is the perfect synergy of taste and efficacy.    17 DELICIOUS FLAVORS - Equally as disappointing as the outdated formulations in this industry is the taste of the typical ‘go to’ energy drink. Consumer palates have become far more refined over the past decade, and the bar has been raised for what will stand out in this absurdly saturated market. This is where we take it home. We are VERY confident when we say that all of our flavors will hang with, or beat, any of the big boys in this industry while providing a far more effective formula.    NO SUGAR OR ARTIFICIAL COLORS - Every single one of our energy drink flavors is sugar-free, does not feature any artificial colors, and is as close to calorie-free as possible.    THIRD-PARTY TESTED - This is a premium formula with premium ingredients. Commensurate with that, we employ third-party testing of not just our powder and capsule formulas but also our energy drinks to constantly oversee the purity of our products.    \n   See more product details",

    "reviews": "Wild Grape Tigers Blood Strawberry Candy Sour Watermelon Candy Orange Rush Orange Ice Dream Mango Peach Lychee Bomb Lucky Lemon Exotic Kiwi Bombsicle Blackberry Lemonade Black Cherry Vanilla Berry Burst Arctic White Variety Pack #2 Variety Pack #1 Tropic Wave Going to break this up a bit. Tl:dr, tastes great, works well, price is fine, packaging sucks a bit. Taste: So far I've tried Black Cherry Vanilla and Kiwi. Both are really tasty, but I have a preference for Black Cherry Vanilla. These don't taste like low calorie energy drinks, and not much like energy drinks at all. You don't get that annoying, acidic and metallic taste that many energy drinks have. Instead it's smooth, tastes as advertised, and has no weird aftertaste. If there was a decaf I would drink it for the taste alone. Efficacy: Different people react differently to supplements. With that out of the way, the dosages are well within the \"effective\" range and I haven't found a nootropic on the market with these dosages combined. Derek has a video nearly an hour and a half long on YouTube breaking down the active ingredients, what they do, and studies that back their efficacy. Personally and anecdotally, wowza. The caffeine level is akin to a normal energy drink so you get the initial hit, but no jitters. Then the nootropics kick in (then take 30 min to an hour on average for most people). Focus is insane, word recall is noticable, and mood is enhanced. I got more used to it after a while, but the first day I cleaned most of my house because I was so hyped. At this point, I can't imagine a day without one. I know for the sake of my wallet I should slow down, but I love how both energizing and calming the drink is at the same time. Cost: It's not the cheapest. That said, it is way cheaper than Starbucks or any coffee shop. I often go to my local coffee shop to get work done, but that ends up costing me like $6-7 (with tip) per day for an iced coffee or iced black eye. I would sometimes pop by the corner store to get a Monster for the weekend or something. That was $3, which is cheaper than redbull. If you do the math, as of now Gorilla Mind energy comes out to around $3 a can, and is way higher quality then redbull. So, I'm saving money if I don't go to the coffee shop and breaking even with Monster. Packaging: There are plenty of pictures of cans being damaged and it's true. A few of mine arrived damage, and the quality of the materials on the cans isn't the best. That said, it's so good that I'm not deducting a star. Really a game changer, I recommend giving it a go. If you are unsure, watch Derek's video on YouTube. Read more | 5.0\nI accidentally tried one for free in my work office and immediately have to order a full pack of this from Amazon, I was so impressed by all the active ingredient and efficacy of it. 100% recommend to everyone who want a daily brain boost to replace daily Coffee/Caffeine. Most energy drinks out there are just lots of Sugar and Caffeine, while this one contains all the core Active Ingredient for mind clarity that I regularly take in Pills format, so I don't have to shove in 5-6 pills a day on top of my daily supplements anymore thanks to this. I wish its more widely available in all other Asia countries when I travel. The only downside for me is that the drink is Carbonated which give me mild stomach bloat and gas issue (still less issues than all the other Soda brands), and the Caffeine content is a bit too high for me (200 mg), I usually take 1-2 Caffeine Gums a day (with 50 mg of Caffeine per pill), and 200 mg is a bit too strong for me since I'm very sensitive to Caffeine. Arctic White Flavor taste really good though, just like Sprite with no sugar, now I can fully replaced my daily Coke Zero can with this one. Read more | 5.0\nGreat taste, energy and focus! Love Gorilla Mind products! Read more | 5.0\nI have had two cases previously purchased. The first case was Orange and the flavor was amazing and had no damage. The second case, that was damaged. Not to the point of it needing to be returned but about 25% of the product needed to be opened with tools due to damage sustained in shipping. With the product being amazing I again ordered more but the last two shipments have been damaged to the point Amazon has labeled to be non-deliverable. While it is nice to not have to go through a claim process it is highly frustrating to have two separate orders marked as undeliverable, a refund automated, no new order being immediately processed, and this is already on top of the abnormally longer shipment time for these beverages. I love Gorilla Mind, their products, and their services, it is sadly just apparent there is a disconnect between GM and Amazon as the product can't even arrive to its final destination without being damaged or destroyed. I will give it one more chance before trying to find an alternative option. Read more | 1.0\nNot my favorite flavor but good nonetheless. These drinks keep me focused and alert for work. By far the best energy drink on the market as far as physical and cognitive impact, and taste. Also, this is one of the few energy drinks that uses methycobalimin, along with other excellent vitamins, specifically vitamin C. Read more | 4.0\n5.0",

    "reviews": "Orange Cream Mixed Tray Blueberry Tart VALR Energy has quickly become my favorite energy drink! The flavor is perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and it gives me hours of smooth, focused energy without the jitters or dreaded crash. Knowing it’s made with natural ingredients makes it an easy, guilt-free choice for staying energized throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the two flavor pack with Orange Cream and Blueberry Tart. Orange Cream was my personal favorite out of the 2. As someone that is picky with energy drinks, I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. Neither had that fake energy drink taste that some of the other brands on the market have. The were tasty but not too sweet. The caffeine content was perfect to give you mental focus but none of the weird jittery feeling. I felt focused and awake all day without any crash also! The nitrogen gives the drinks a little bit of carbonation without being overpowering. As someone that also prioritizes their health, I really like that this brand has clean ingredients and is more geared toward a healthy lifestyle. 10/10 would buy again and recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using VALR Nitrogen Infused energy drinks for a few weeks now, and I’m impressed with the boost they provide without the usual jitters. As an active mother, I need something that helps with both focus and stamina during my workouts, and this does the trick. The smooth, refreshing taste makes it easy to enjoy, and I love that it doesn’t leave me feeling drained later on. Overall, it’s a great energy drink that supports my busy lifestyle Read more | 5.0\nI’m usually pretty hesitant to try most energy drinks because they make me jittery and often taste like chemicals, but I decided to try VALR because of the green tea extract and nitrogenation.. and this is actually delicious! The nitrogen makes the liquid feel thicker/gives the satisfaction of carbonation, without the actual bubbles or gas aftermath.  I got the variety pack to try both flavors- the orange reminded me of an orange and cream sorbet, and the blueberry (my fav) literally just tasted like blueberry green tea. I have the mental and physical energy, without feeling anxious or shaky. Definitely recommend at least giving them a try!! Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who's pretty sensitive to caffeine, this was a nice mid-day pick me up and I could feel my alertness level rise after drinking less than half the can, no jitters. The sweetness level works for me (I like sweet drinks) and the fact that it's infused with nitrogen makes for a really smooth texture that felt like a treat. I'm going to start having one before my workout classes. Orange is my fav - will continue to repurchase! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of an energy drink consumer because most of the drinks on the market have way too much caffeine! The can only has 175mg of caffeine through green tea. I did not experience any weird jitters or crashes after drinking the entire can. The other things I love about the product is its focus on natural juices and flavoring as well as it being nitrogenated. I was also able to drink an entire can before a workout with no bloat that you would typically get from a carbonated drink making my workout comfortable. This is a great product! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been searching for a clean, effective energy drink, and VALR is now my go-to. The taste is refreshing and not overly sweet, which I love. It provides a steady energy boost that keeps me focused for hours without the jittery feeling or crash I’ve experienced with other brands. Plus, it’s packed with natural ingredients, which makes me feel good about drinking it. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nVALR is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the orange, but the blueberry is also super satisfying. I was expecting carbonation like other energy drinks, but the nitrogenated texture was a pleasant surprise. It’s a bit thicker but without the carbonation, so no burping side effects! I’m focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough protein while leading a healthy lifestyle. One thing I love about Valr is that it mixes perfectly with my clear protein powder for a refreshing, energizing boost. It’s delicious on its own and even better with protein. I can’t say enough great things about this energy drink! The energy boost from Valr is different from other drinks. It doesn’t give me a big spike and then a crash. Instead, it provides a natural, lasting boost that maximizes my focus, energy levels, and attentiveness, making it a great companion for my workday mornings. I’m a die-hard fan of the orange flavor and can’t wait to start all my days with it. I’ll be ordering another case soon! I would love to try other flavors as they come out with new ones!

As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout.

This flavor is very unique and I haven’t really tasted anything else like this except a limeade from sonic a very long time ago. This monster has another unique thing and that’s the nitrogen they used instead of carbonation. You can tell there’s a difference there. The flavor had some getting use to at first, almost like a wine. But by the 3rd or 4th one I was hooked! One of my top 5 monster flavors now for sure. Would buy again.

    "reviews": "Love the taste. Read more | 5.0\nI have used the standard 5-hour Energy drinks before, but had never tried the 'Extra Strength' version.  So when I got the opportunity to try them out I jumped at it.  I mainly use these drinks for a pre-workout boost, which is how I tested this one. The manufacturer recommends either consuming 1/2 a bottle for 'moderate energy' or a full bottle for 'maximum energy'.  They also suggest no more than 2 bottles daily; consumed several hours apart.  Since I was testing the benefits of use as a pre-workout energy booster, I went for the full bottle. The first thing I noted was the flavor.  The name 'Tidal Twist' implies something tropical, and the first flavor I picked up was a hint of coconut, with sort of a fruit background.  As with most energy drinks, the flavor is not great, but it definitely is not unpleasant. Of course the reason I was taking the energy shot was to boost my workout.  Per the manufacturer each bottle (shot) contains the caffeine equivalent to a 12-oz cup of premium coffee (230 mg), in addition to an 'energy blend'.  I took the shot roughly 30 minutes prior to starting my workout, which was a 50-minute stationary cycling workout followed by some light weight lifting.  I definitely had an added boost to my endurance, which was measured in my average RPMs and calories burned on the ride.  I also still had good energy for the weights, and there was no post-workout crash. A concern I have with any energy boosting supplement is potential stomach upset.  I am happy to say I did not experience any negative side effects.  One effect of note, which is mentioned by the manufacturer is potential for 'niacin flushing'.  I can definitely say I did run hotter, and sweat more, during the workout after taking this energy shot.  But, I did not view this as a negative so did not deduct from the product rating for it. Read more | 5.0\nI have been a fan of 5 hour products on every long trip I have had with a set arrival time. These are double shot bottles, meaning every bottle is two servings. I recommend only using half of one at a time. I am accustomed to the normal 5 hour flavor, being mostly overpowered by b12. These however, are strongly  masked by a pineapple/coconut flavor, but followed up by a terrible after taste that lasts about three seconds. So, it lost a star for my, and what I would assume to be general tastes of others. . Buy these is you like tropical flavors, but don't like the other 5 hour existing flavors. Read more | 4.0\nI have tried other brands of energy drinks as well as different flavors of this same vitamin energy drink and found that this is the best kind of energy drink for my focus and relief from tiredness. I use half a bottle in the morning  and the other half midday. I haven't noticed any unsteadiness or jitters, which is wonderful compared to other caffeine drinks that have left me feeling shaky. This vitamin drink has lots of vitamin b though also a lot of caffeine, but doesn't give me a let down or crash feeling at all. It's easy to take and since they are so well sealed and the screw lids stay on well, I  can carry it around, even after I drink half of it, the second half doesn't spill out. However, this particular flavor is not my favorite. It's kind of a sour sweet tangy taste, but there's a  metallic taste that I don't get from other flavors. Read more | 5.0\nThese 5-hour energy drinks work really well and very fast. When I tried the first one I couldn't believe how quickly I began to feel energized. And I was really struggling that morning to keep focused on work. These things were a life saver. So easy to drink. You can down the entire thing in just one or two gulps. And the flavor was really nice. I've had some other energy drinks that were nasty tasting going down and lingered with more nasty aftertaste. These were not that way at all. They go down smooth with no lingering aftertaste. That is very much appreciated. And the energy I got from the first bottle lasted several hours. I was able to finish my work day with no problem. This product has made a believer out of me. I will definitely be buying it again. I highly recommend it if you ever need that quick pick me up. Read more | 5.0\nEnergy level seemed on par with other 5-hour energy extra strength flavors, same amount of side effects as well (nothing new there). As someone who doesn't particularly enjoy the taste of most flavors of these, I can say these aren't any better or worse for me. They do have a hint of \"tropical\" pineapple/coconut and a terrible after taste (which again seems standard) but for the most part I'm in it for the energy and not the flavor. I could see me buying these again. The price is a bit much, but if you are buying these individually at a convenience store every day Amazon could be saving you some cash. Read more | 5.0\nThe 5-Hour Energy Extra Strength Shots in Tidal Twist Flavor deliver the consistent energy boost you'd expect from this brand, but the flavor is intense and unique. Pros: ✔ Highly Effective – Provides a strong and lasting energy boost without the jitters or crash. ✔ Convenient Size – Small and easy to take on the go, perfect for a quick pick-me-up. ✔ Extra Strength Formula – Great for when you need maximum alertness and focus. Cons: ✘ Bold Flavor – Has a distinct tropical citrus taste. Maybe perfumey...which may not be for everyone. ✘ Intensity Overload – If you're sensitive to strong flavors, this one might be too overpowering. While the flavor may be hit or miss, the effectiveness is undeniable. If you need an energy boost that works, this extra strength shot gets the job done! Read more | 5.0\nI thought this was a little hard to drink because I thought it wasted kind of bad. The flavor does taste tropical. Something like coconut, but it was a little bitter and also incredibly sweet. Luckily each bottle is relatively small. It did give me energy, though it also made me a bit unfocused and jittery. I don't recommend downing the whole bottle, but taking little sips especially for those who aren't used to energy drinks. Read more | 3.0",

If you love gfuel buy this gfuel. I love it. All jokes aside the flavor is pretty good, It's a sweet but just right type of flavor.

I have trouble finding these around me and saw a good sale for them on Amazon.  Buying a case of them comes out to a better price than individually at the store by at least a dollar.  So that is a great value. What I didn’t like is while they are shipped shrink wrapped as shown in the product listing photos, they came in an additional amazon box but when I opened them the cans are all dented.  They are dented in places you wouldn’t expect as well.  There was no leaking and nothing ruptured, just oddly dented cans.

I had to go to the G Fuel site itself in order to figure out what this is.  Apparently, it's supposed to be \"rainbow candy\" flavor. It is a candy flavor, but it's strange.  If I think \"rainbow candy\" I think of things like Skittles, Starburst, or Life Savers or something like that.  It's not close to any of those to me anyway, instead it's this weird artificial candy flavor, as odd as that sounds.  Perhaps an artificial fruit flavor(s) mixed with a hint of coconut?  It's hard to describe and not what I expected. It's not so terrible that I can't drink it---I hate wasting stuff---but I would not buy this again.

    "reviews": "Wild Fruit Punch Orange Mango Tropical Life I enjoy zero or low calorie energy drinks . I saw these on sale and decided to give them a try . I bought a few flavors , this is about the Fruit Punch in particular as it's a very common flavor amongst energy drinks . The first sip gave me an immediate hint of grain cereal smell , a smell that I personally love . It is not carbonated so it's smooth going down . The fruity flavor is strong and pleasant . It's got a lot of flavor going on for only 35 calories . The only slight aftertaste that I get is again of grain cereal and it's very light . I like these a lot , recommended . Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor isn’t fruit punch, bland and kind of metal flavor. Not impressed. I will not be purchasing it again. Sorry Read more | 1.0\nThis is an energy drink that has lots of energy and lots of flavor. It tastes and drinks like fruit juice. The fruit punch flavor was absolutely delicious. Reminded me of the fruit punch I used to drink as a kid, but without sugar. I drank it in the morning and stayed focused and energized pretty much the entire day. Looking forward to trying the other flavors. Read more | 5.0\nI had really high hopes for this one, excited that it is non-carbonated and figured it would be great for mornings.  The flavor isn't terrible and it's smooth but it has such a powerful herbal/vitamin smell and taste that completely overpowers any orange or mango flavor.  Kinda struggling to drink them. I mean it does the trick with more caffeine than most energy drinks, but man that herbal taste and smell just kinda wrecks it for me. Read more | 2.0\nSmells like pee that's been sitting around a while. Taste isn't awful but the smell makes it undrinkable really. Read more | 1.0\nSo this product isn’t bad per se. I gave it 3 stars (it’s more like 3.5), but it could easily be 4 star. I prefer uncarbonated energy drinks but most are lower on the caffeine content, so I was glad to see one with 260 mg for those days when I need a little more oomph. Where this product goes wrong is in the taste which could be a death sentence for an energy drink. While I don’t mind the taste, it’s a little cough syrupy and will easily turn off some consumers. The big problem with the taste is really the result of there being whey protein in this product. It changes the texture and gives it an off taste. Hard to describe but if you’ve ever had a liquid protein drink (think fruit drink not protein shake), you know the taste I’m talking about. If it was giving me 10-20 grams of protein, I might be ok to overlook the weird taste as it’s expected, but this product contains only 3 grams??? What’s the point?? It’s totally unnecessary and I think removing it would do wonders for the overall taste. What benefit am I really getting from 3 grams of protein? All that being said, I still kinda like it and have bought it a few times. And if it ever comes back in stock, I’d probably buy it again. I prefer the fruit punch over the tropical (I haven’t tried the other flavor) even if it tastes like protein cough syrup. I just hope the manufacturer reads these reviews because I see I’m not the only person to call out the protein taste. Take it out and I think you’d have a much superior product to market. But that’s just my opinion. Read more | 3.0\nI bought this for what it does - good energy, plus some protein, and zero sugar - and it does that, so I am happy. Taste is perfectly reasonable. I'm not looking for a decadent cocktail. I want energy, plus protein, with zero sugar. Read more | 5.0\nTastes mostly like powdery protein. Did not like the flavor of this at all - couldn't taste the orange/mango over the overpowering taste of powdery protein. If they left the Protein out it might taste better, and 3g of Protein doesn't seem worth it for the bad taste. Would not buy again. Read more | 1.0",

    "reviews": "Tropical Taste Pack Fruity Flavors Bundle Wild Orange White Peach Tropical Punch Super Berry Strawberry Watermelon Remix Variety Pack Pineapple Coconut Mango Splash Green Apple Frosted Grape Cherry Limeade Dwanta's Holiday Punch Variety Pack Alright, let’s talk energy drinks. I’ve tried a bunch of them, and Zoa energy drinks are definitely up there with the best. They’re packed with good stuff like vitamins, electrolytes, and amino acids, and they give me a solid energy boost without making me feel jittery. Plus, the flavors are pretty awesome – I mean, who doesn’t love a good Tropical Punch or Pineapple Coconut? But here’s the thing – as much as I love Zoa for a midday pick-me-up, I still start my mornings with Yerba Magic. There’s just something about it that sets the tone for the day. Yerba Magic is this fantastic instant yerba mate drink that’s super easy to make. Just mix a scoop with water, and you’re good to go. No steeping, no fuss – perfect for my groggy, half-asleep self in the morning. Yerba Magic has this refreshing peach mango flavor that’s a nice wake-up call. It’s packed with prebiotics and probiotics, so my gut feels great, and the energy boost is smooth and steady. I don’t get those annoying jitters or crashes, which is a huge win. It’s like all the benefits of traditional yerba mate without the hassle of brewing it. I usually get mine in less than two days when I order it off Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5YVMX9Q Yerba Magic is loaded with prebiotics and probiotics, which are key players in maintaining a healthy digestive system. The prebiotics, like chicory inulin and apple fiber, help nourish the good bacteria in your gut, making them more effective. This, in turn, supports better digestion and overall gut health. Since I started drinking Yerba Magic, I’ve noticed a significant reduction in bloating and digestive discomfort. So, my routine goes like this: I kick off the day with Yerba Magic to get my head straight and my energy flowing. Then, if I need an extra boost later in the day, I grab a Zoa. It’s the perfect combo – Yerba Magic keeps me focused and balanced in the morning, and Zoa gives me that extra push when I need it, especially during those afternoon slumps. In short, Zoa energy drinks are fantastic, but Yerba Magic is my go-to for starting the day right. If you’re looking for a great way to boost your mornings and stay energized throughout the day, give this combo a try. You won’t be disappointed! Read more | 5.0\nNew favorite energy drink! All of the flavors were good, although, not a huge fan of the watermelon. Has about 160mg of caffeine vs other drinks with 200. Caffeine comes from green tea and green coffee beans. Has multiple vitamins and electrolytes. I wish I could find them in bulk at stores! Read more | 5.0\nI was a hardcore Celcius fan and prior to that a Red Bull fan. But wanted to give ZOA a try. I first tried the Tropical Punch flavor and right away, love it! It doesn't have the weird \"fake sugar\" taste that usually gives me a headache. It's crisp and honestly tastes like a light, fresh, less sweet Hawaiian Punch with a little fizz. And NO JITTERS! It's a clean, smooth energy that doesn't feel unnatural. I love that it comes in a 16-ounce option. My only complaint is the price because it can be pricey at times but it does seem to fluctuate. Cherry flavor is good as well. Read more | 5.0\nZoa Energy is my go-to energy beverage.  I love the orange flavor. Do not like the big price increase that’s recently occurred which is why I’m deducting 1-star. Read more | 4.0\nWill buy again! I was looking for a drink that isn't too sweet, doesn't taste like chemicals or smell like a beer. This is it! The fruit flavor is a little too mild for my liking. But, it's great just the same! I live the variety, the not overbearing sweetness. I like to share new products with my co workers which is what I did when these arrived. I do believe we will all be ordering these in the future. Green 🍏 apple is good. Pineapple Coconut 🍍🥥is good. Not a huge fan of anything peach flavored. But the white peach 🍑is good too. Next on the list is Orange 🍊 , and I am looking forward to that! Read more | 5.0\nNot much on sports drinks but I do like the Zoe flavor original taste with low calories and green tea pick me up. However, I have been trying to buy more orders through Amazone and have had little to no success.  I hope the I can see this product in local Wal-Mart, Cosco, or GMC in the northeast parts of Texas. This product I definitely would like to continue to purchase. Read more | 5.0\nGreat flavor, it doesn’t take like it’s sugar free! I’m very happy I could find the 16oz cans again! Sadly, one of the cans was busted when it arrived but it’s ok because it’s still a great value even with 11, rather than 12. Read more | 5.0",

The taste is, well extremely salty, but not bad. They taste better from the cans than the packets in my experience but the packets are easier to keep around and to adjust to whatever size water bottle I'm using that day. They're the only thing I've found that actually helps with a hangover, they help with energy levels, the magnesium helps me sleep better, they're just top quality all around. I've tried every hydration/electrolyte drink on the market and these are by far the best I've found for my needs. I feel hydrated without being in the bathroom all day, with no extra sugar like the usual sports drinks. They're worth the cost, I put them on subscribe and save and I haven't been dehydrated since.

The watermelon flavor is refreshing, with a unique hint of salt that enhances the taste and helps balance hydration. With no sugar, it's a great option for those looking for a clean, guilt-free energy boost. The 12-count pack makes it convenient for daily use, whether after workouts or as a tasty, hydrating refreshment. A great choice for anyone looking to stay hydrated! 💧🍉✨ Read more | 5.0\nI normally have either water or electrolyte powder when I need it, but never seem to have both. This resolves that issue, and I enjoy additional carbonation. I found this product to be too concentrated for my taste, but it is perfect with some extra water added and poured over ice. I love that it has high levels of sodium, it helps my POTS a lot more than most of the other electrolyte drinks I have tried. And the taste is much better than other electrolytes I have tried.

They do taste like alcohol tho in my opinion -The citrus salt taste just like a mojito to me. -The watermelon salt taste like a fruit punch four loco -The black cherry lime like a flat roman coke but nice cheery taste -I despise grapefruit but the grapefruit salt one is actually my favorite. Usually it takes me all day and night to drink a can because it's salty but I was able to drink it in less then an hour..leave my breath smell like alcohol back taste in a way. Their good tho..my body tolerates the electrolytes better then other electrolytes I tried. Wish price was cheaper but it is what is is.

    "reviews": "Root Beer Pink Lemonade Peach Mango Orange Sunrise Dr. Bum Citrus Burst Cherry Frost Champion Mentality Blueberry Lemonade Blue Snow Cone Grape I love BUM Energy drinks, I can't get enough of them, I guess you could say I'm addicted, a true BUMaholic(TM). Sorry Chris, can't use that one. BUM Energy drinks are unique. They taste like a soda, feel like a soda, and look like one. I'm tired of the overly sweet, 300mg caffeine energy drinks trying to get the biggest can out there for consumer gluttony. So when I found BUM, I gave it a try and became hooked. BUM energy drinks give you a slight caffeine boost and uptick in mental clarity. I enjoy a cup or two of coffee in the morning, but in the afternoon I'll drink one of these to keep me going before a workout. I have had almost every flavor of BUM, there is still the elusive pink lemonade I haven't been able to find yet. But for flavor ratings: Cherry Frost : tastes like a Cherry Cola. The best in my opinion. Root Beer: does have a slight \"diet\" flavor, but the best of the root beer energy drinks I've had. If you enjoy root beer you'll enjoy this. Cirtus Blast: If you're familiar with Sprite or 7up, this is very similar: crisp, clean citrus flavor. Champion Mentality: tough choice between this and orange sunrise. Champion Mentality takes this spot for me because it is lighter on the sweetness. Slightly more tart flavor than Citrus Blast. Orange Sunrise: A bit, sweet, but not too much. Almost like an orange popsicle, but very refreshing. Blue Snow Cone: its been a while since I have had this one, a little harder to find at times. It's a sweet flavor, very reminiscent of the \"blue\" flavor of similar drinks. IYKYK Blueberry Lemonade: this is tangy, very slight blueberry flavor with a tangy, acidic after taste. I find this to be a refreshing, sipping beverage. It gets me excited for the pink lemonade! Peach Mango: I'm a huge fan of these two flavors and the combination had me excited. I found it to be a little on the sweet side with a bit more \"diet\" taste. Still a very refreshing drink and one to try if you're a fan of the flavor combination. If you haven't tried BUM Energy drinks yet, you're missing out on the best energy drinks out there. For those of you who like energy drinks, give these a try. One sip and you'll be hooked, switching from the Reigns, Bangs, Monsters, etc. You just cannot beat the quality of these drinks, you get no jitters or crash, just clean energy. Chris, how about a simple \"Cola\" flavor? And don't change the cans, I love the simplicity of a 12oz soda can. Read more | 5.0\nI'm writing because the review checker gives the quality of reviews on this listing an F... but I purchased this product bc I'm trying to lower the amount of caffeine I drink (I was drinking A LOT for me to be coming down to BUM's level). Suffice to say, I've now gone through one pack and I am now a customer. the product is EXCELLENT. Just enough caffeine, it's not a giantic can of drinnk so you don't feel bloated like with a monster or ghost or rockstar and above all... The ROOTBEER is EXCELLENT. Like wow, the taste is great. Cannot emphasize to you that after drinking dozens of brands over the decades that this one is a stand out. I am waiting on their Dr. Bum flavor... and I wish they would come out with a Cola flavor but so far, I want to commend them on a great product in the midrange Caffeination (is that word? IS NOW !) for folks who are discovering that their kidneys might matter in the future. KEep up the good work Bum! Read more | 5.0\nGreat product, the flavor is on point and ingredients are awesome!

    "reviews": "We love the taste of this so much. Hubby uses to take to work. Sometime I did. But often I drink it with meals or if I'm relaxing. Caffeine helps him. I drink it slowly. I have heart arrhythmia, so I have yo be aware of it. I also have the opposite effect (same with allergy meds and other things). But caffeine makes me sleepy and relaxed. But because of my heart I have to remain aware of that danger. But these imports are the best. Super expensive. But work well and taste great. Wish they had a sugar free one to try.

I'd say its got the same taste as the regular green cans but these have a \"smoother\" taste. Import is also about 2oz more than the standard 16oz, hence more caffeine. Oh and it has a fancy sort of resealable design in the form of a cap that you slide open/close. The only downside I see here is the price. I bought the 12 count and in my opinion it's too expensive to be a repeat purchase. Read more | 4.0\nYou want a little extra boost, monster imports, one to do it specially on ice. It’s awesome.

It's tasty, gives me steady energy, and keeps me feeling good even after my workout. If you're looking for something to help you power through your gym sessions without the crash, I definitely recommend giving this a try! Extended explanation: I've been trying out the drink for a month now, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for my workouts! I'm not an expert, but I do try different pre workout drinks and I know what makes me feel good, and this drink definitely does the trick. **Taste and Flavor** First off, the Guava Paradise flavor is delicious! When this went on sale, I only bought two cans because I typically dislike the flavor of guava drinks. This one, however, is not like that it is so perfect. It's got this perfect mix of sweet and tart that makes it super refreshing. Plus, it's not too fizzy, so it doesn't leave me feeling bloated. **Energy Boost** What I love most about this drink is the energy boost it gives me. I feel more awake and ready to tackle my workout without feeling jittery. The energy comes on smoothly and lasts throughout my session, which is awesome because I hate that crash you get with some other energy drinks. **No Crash** Speaking of crashes, there's none with this one! I can go through my entire workout and still feel good afterward. It's great for those days when I need a little extra push but don't want to feel wiped out later. Read more | 5.0\nThese are delicious. There’s a strong green apple flavor, but it’s not overly sour or difficult to drink.

I order this so much. Grape, Cali Cola and Tangerine Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been trying out different energy drinks, this one is not one of my favorites.  It’s not terrible but this is not one of the better ones on the market in my opinion. - It’s advertised as not jittery energy, but it feels very jittery to me. I feel shaky, less focused, not more. Almost anxious. I don’t know why. - it’s very acidic, and can be tough on your stomach.  Lifting weights with a stomachache is actually detrimental in the gym, makes your workout worse, not better. - I got the Guava flavor, I don’t expect energy drinks to be delicious and maybe the other flavors are better, but this one tastes like Guava flavored gasoline.  Bangs flavors don’t have that yuck effect, it’s hard to want to finish a whole can of this product even though it’s only 12 oz. For ‘moderate’ caffeine, I’d rather drink a rehab iced tea by monster, not carbonated, no stomachache, tastes good, and provides some hydration with a good energy level that doesn’t leave you feeling strung out like a speed addict when it wears off. For maximum energy hit when you really need to get crazy in the gym and don’t give a crap about anything else, nothing I’ve tried so far beats a full bottle of Redline.  Can’t be healthy for you but it’s the most powerful I’ve tried and it’s 3 gulps, no carbonation, and you’re ready to throw a fit with the weights.  Just don’t take it late in the day, you’ll regret it. I gave Oxyshred a try, won’t be ordering it again. Read more | 2.0\n2.0",

    "reviews": "Reserve White Pineapple Reserve Orange Dreamsicle pineapple orange These are the best flavor of any Monster Energy drink. I mean, orange cream, what could be better! Let’s go ahead and breakdown the flavor combination on this one. It’s got one hell of a profile! I’ll start with the orange. The orange flavor on these is so good. I thought I was somewhere warm with an actual orange! It’s like a vacation in a can! Then there’s the 2nd part of the flavor, the cream. The cream flavor was super creamy. It literally reminds me of that meme of the Amish woman churning cream with that wooden Amish thing. I’ve been drinking Monster products and other energy drinks for about 25 years. With my vast experience and the countless cans I’ve tried there has only been one other drink that was better than this one… the Lost perfect 10, and since that is no longer produced, this is the best energy drink on the market today. Read more | 5.0\nThis Monster Energy Orange Dreamsicle is like sipping pure nostalgia while getting hit by a lightning bolt of energy. Imagine your favorite childhood ice cream truck pulling up, but instead of a dreamsicle, you get a can full of rocket fuel for adults. One sip and I was ready to tackle my to-do list, reorganize my life, and possibly start a small business – all while reminiscing about summer days as a kid. It’s got the perfect orange-vanilla flavor that hits just right, but don’t let the smooth taste fool you – this stuff will have you buzzing around like a caffeinated hummingbird. I’m not saying it gives you superpowers, but I did finish a week’s worth of work in about two hours after downing one. Side note: my hands were shaking, but that’s a small price to pay for this kind of productivity. If you want to relive your childhood and feel like you can run through walls, this is the drink for you. 10/10, would definitely recommend – but proceed with caution unless you’re ready to be a human tornado.

I love anything that is blueberry, blackberry, or sort of tangy tasting and these are so good and tangy. Second- they are the perfect size. I used to drink rockstars and they were simply too big and I could never finish a full can so it would just be wasted. Because it would be flat later on or the next morning. You can actually leave these Reb bulls sitting out all day and they don’t go flat. Third- the price is decent. They end up being about $1.67 per drink as of this time. That’s not too bad for an energy drink in my opinion. Last of all, they are a slightly yellow/clear color and do not stain your teeth. I used to be obsessed with fruit punch rockstars and they were bright red. I had to quit drinking them because they were staining my teeth. So I appreciate the fact that these are clear with just a slight yellowish tinge and do not stain my teeth. Read more | 5.0\nNot only do they taste great, but getting them delivered is so easy.

Read more | 5.0\nRed Bull has been my go-to energy drink for years, and this 24-pack is a convenient and cost-effective way to keep a steady supply on hand. Taste: The classic Red Bull flavor is unique – a blend of sweetness and tartness with a slight medicinal note. It's definitely an acquired taste, but I personally enjoy it. The carbonation adds a refreshing kick, and the 8.4 fl oz size is perfect for a quick boost without feeling overwhelmed. Effectiveness: Red Bull is known for its ability to provide a quick burst of energy, and it delivers on that promise. The combination of caffeine, taurine, and B vitamins helps me power through long workdays, workouts, or late-night study sessions. I notice a significant improvement in my focus and alertness within minutes of drinking it. Ingredients: While Red Bull is effective, it's important to be mindful of the ingredients. It does contain a significant amount of sugar and caffeine, so moderation is key. I wouldn't recommend drinking it every day, but it's a great option for occasional use when you need an extra boost. Packaging: The 24-pack is great for stocking up. The cans are sturdy and easy to transport, and the packaging keeps them fresh. Overall: If you're looking for a reliable energy drink that delivers a noticeable energy boost, Red Bull is a solid choice. The 24-pack is a convenient and cost-effective option, and while the taste might not be for everyone, the effectiveness is undeniable. Just be sure to consume it in moderation due to the sugar and caffeine content. Read more | 5.0\nFull price it's way too expensive online, I usually get this in wal-mart where it's half the price.

Caffeine content just right for me. I only drink half a can a day and it supplies enough energy to get me going on days I don’t have time to make coffee Read more | 5.0\nTastes good, quality ingredients and kept me awake to finish term papers overnight. Read more | 5.0\nIf you're anything like me, you have a busy life, and getting 8+ hours of sleep every night just doesn't happen. You need something to get through your day, and the proliferation of mass-market energy drinks has led you to chugging one, two, three or even more in a day! Not good! I know my own Bed Rull (clever!) drinking was getting out-of-control, and it was having a serious impact on both my health and my wallet. In my desperation for a source of healthier, more cost and eco friendly energy, I turned to my local natural grocery store and found this: GURU Lite. Made with Stevia instead of all those \"let's all wait for the news story about the horrible health impacts\" artificial sweeteners, and containing only ingredients you can actually pronounce (sparking water, lemon juice, cane juice, guarana seed, luo han gua juice, steevia, echinacea, ginko, ginseng)it sounded pretty promising. But what about the energy? Well it works, I took my first sip, went \"oh well, crap, doesn't work\" and then 2 minutes later I was awake! No jitters, no \"surge-o-epic caffeine\" - just awake. It's refreshing, if you're used to the \"wired wired wired wired zing zoom bzzzzz crash!\" of normal energy drinks, get ready for one that actually just makes you feel like yourself. Not wired, not tired, not cranky, not crazy, just a couple extra hours of focus as YOU! But what about the flavor? GURU Lite is best described as \"not bad\", I like it room temperature, you may prefer it chilled. Unlike those commercial heart-attacks-in-a-can, GURU focused on health over sugar-load, so expect a slightly lemony, earthy herbal taste. It is not by an means bad tasting, but it's not like liquid candy, it's a simple, natural flavor that doesn't overwhelm or make you want to chug twenty of them. You drink this for the health and energy, and the taste is secondary. I don't want you to think \"oh it tastes bad...\" because it doesn't, it's just the taste is definitely not the focus, it's not a soda, it's more like a glass of water - you drink it because you're thirsty, and this, you drink because you are tired and want to be awake. What about the cost? Well, Amazon has the best deal around. I chose the subscribe-and-save option and came home to find a box, wrapped in a clear plastic wrap to protect against rain, two days later. Inside was my case of GURU (which looks exactly like the picture). I found with GURU not only am I drinking fewer of them than I did with Bed Rull, but I'm able to sleep better and of course I'm ending each month with tons of cash in my pocket that is no longer being spent on over-priced, junk-laden commercial \"energy\". And the best part? I have all the energy I want at hand in a far, far healthier package. Give it a shot today, you will be pleasantly surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI don’t typically like sparkling drinks. They are hard to drink. They tend to make me feel bloated, and usually they taste terrible because they’re meant to be on the lighter side, calorie wise. For example, Celsius sparkling drinks. I LOVE the non carbonates drinks they make! But the sparkling/carbonation side of them make them hard to enjoy, and the taste is not as good as their non carbonated drinks. If you’ve tried them, you know what I mean. These drinks are also sparkling, but somehow they aren’t as “carbonated” feeling and tasting! Impressive! They have a perfect balance for that effect. Makes it easier to chug when I’m in a hurry. Was also worried about the taste! I’ve never tasted Yerba mate, so I was expecting a very strong earthy taste. It mostly taste like a delicate mint taste with a mild “artificial” sweetening aftertaste and a hint of tea. Seriously impressed. Usually when you see all these healthier ingredients you know it’s good for you, or better for you anyways, but you know it’s probably not going to taste very good. One example of a “lighter” drink such as this one, or similar anyways as far as the use of “better ingredients” in the product, is the jocko willink energy drink. In the ingredients list, you will see things that will make you feel better about drinking the product. But it doesn’t taste good at all. This drink has great ingredients and balanced use of them to give it just enough taste and carbonation, to enjoy. I’m amazed with this product and will buy two more of these cases. I regret not getting the variety packs at sams when they did carry them, because I want to try the other flavors. Give these a shot if you so t mins a light tasting, light carbonation effect energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI wasted $50.00 on an unsuspecting change in recipe that showed up at my door.

    "reviews": "I snagged a 12-pack of CELSIUS Sparkling Kiwi Guava, and dude, it’s my new pre-workout jam! The kiwi-guava combo is tart, sweet, and tropical—sips like a vacation vibe. No sugar, no junk like aspartame or high fructose corn syrup, just clean energy from green tea and guarana. I felt the kick without the jitters, thanks to that MetaPlus blend with B vitamins and chromium—kept me pumped and not starving mid-run. It’s vegan, gluten-free, and Kosher, so it fits my picky diet. The 12 oz. slim cans are clutch for on-the-go. Only beef? It’s fizzy, so if you’re not into carbonation, heads-up. Otherwise, it’s a solid pick-me-up for crushing goals and staying fit without the usual energy drink crash. CELSIUS, you’ve got a fan! Read more | 5.0\nThe CELSIUS Arctic Vibe Sparkling Frozen Berry is my absolute go-to energy drink! As a mom of three, working from home, and streaming, I need something to keep me going—and this does the job without the crash! What I Love: ✔ Great Flavor – The Frozen Berry taste is refreshing and not overly sweet. It’s my favorite from the Celsius lineup! ✔ Clean Energy Boost – Gives me just the right amount of energy without the jittery feeling. Perfect for long work hours and late-night streams. ✔ No Crash – Unlike other energy drinks, I don’t feel sluggish after it wears off. ✔ Zero Sugar, But Still Tastes Great – Love that it’s sugar-free yet still delicious and satisfying. ✔ Keeps Me Productive – Whether it’s chasing my kids, grinding through work, or keeping up with my gaming sessions, this drink helps me stay focused and energized. Read more | 5.0\nI love Celsius. In my opinion they are the best energy drink out there! Especially the strawberry lemonade. it’s so good! Not overly sweet ,but just right! Great for a refreshing tasty boost of energy! And also great value. The 12 pack is at a very reasonable price! Read more | 5.0\nFor this price I couldn't pass these up. I had never had this flavor before, but man It taste good. Unlike other energy drinks Celsius gives that boost of energy while not making you feel as bad afterwards. I would give it 10 stars if possible. Read more | 5.0\nI did not get the flavors pictured and I got 2 cans of each flavor and they were quite inferior flavors compared to the better ones. I did not like apple cherry, peach vibe is fine but not as good. In the picture it shows grape and orange which are flavors I like but I didn’t get it Read more | 4.0\nThis is the BEST tasting energy drink ever! The orange is not overly sweet, it tastes like real OJ, and there is a wonderful hint of marshmallow that is spot on. The drink is not too fizzy, not too sweet, not overly caffeinated, and it actually tastes very good! Read more | 5.0\nAs part of my fitness regimen, I started drinking Celsius zero energy drink to boost my performance. Since I began consuming the drink, I have observed improved energy levels during workouts and faster perspiration. I am particularly fond of the peach, fruit punch, and tropical pineapple flavors. Considering the cost, I believe it offers good value for money. However, I must note that the drink contains caffeine, which can cause stomach irritation if I consume the entire can. To avoid this issue, I limit my intake to half a can. Read more | 5.0\nThis is the perfect energy drink I will ever get. It tastes so damn good and even though I do like other carbonated brands, this one I can take my time drinking without the carbonation fizzing out.

    "reviews": "White Gummy Bear Tropical Storm Strawberry Sublime Reignbow Sherbert Razzle Berry Melon Mania Cherry Limeade Orange Dreamsicle Product Name: Reign energy drink Date of Purchase: like every 2 weeks on auto delivery Reason for Purchase: ummm.. caffeine. Features: great taste, quality ingredients, high caffeine amount Quality: good quality Value for Money: well all energy drinks are expensive, my husband and I should definitely buy stock in this company with how much we drink them so I'd say it's good value for the cost. Pros: high amount of caffeine, great taste, doesn't leave an after taste, doesn't make me feel dehydrated, doesn't leave me jittery Cons: now coffee does nothing for me. Overall Rating (out of 5 stars): 5 I would definitely recommend this product for others, it's worth the buy. Read more | 5.0\nThese provide a great deal of caffeine without making you sluggish. I like that they are free of sugar, artificial flavors, but added electrolytes. They make me feel better throughout the day than many other brands. The cons are that some flavors are not good, and you have to chug them if you need the energy. They can be very strongly flavored. Read more | 5.0\nThis is my adult son’s favorite energy drink. Has one every morning and being able to buy them in bulk from Amazon saves him so much money.  We have purchased multiple times. He loves the taste- rainbow sherbet is his favorite- gives him a quick energy boost with no jitters. Can size is great! Read more | 5.0\nI would buy a case every week as I love the taste and the high caffeine content (no crash) and they help me get through intense shifts at work.  I will only buy them when on sale though because the price fluctuates greatly. I'll wait till they sell for under $20. Rarely do they sell for under $20 but since there's so much price gouging and they are already fairly expensive...I can hold out or go with another brand. Read more | 5.0\nWhat you need to know: The Good: - Crisp, grape-ish flavor that isn't overly cloyingly sweet like the other 'fruit' Rockstars. - Great when ice cold, but still palatable when room temperature. As with all of these, too warm and YECCH. - Decent caffeine. A good pick-me-up pep. - Price fluctuates often, leading to deals. I got my cans for $1.30 or so last time, much cheaper than my local grocery store. The Bad: - Price fluctuates often, leading to rip-offs. Sometimes Amazon has a 12 pack for 35+ dollars, which is very pricey for these. - Taste interferes with food. It's odd, but if I try to drink this alongside breakfast (eggs, oatmeal, cereal) the artificial flavorings really spike. It does not complement meals; drink it alone. I like this flavor of Rockstar best of all of the 'fruit' kinds that are readily available, and would recommend this if you like a somewhat Concordy-grape flavored drink. Read more | 4.0\nGreat flavor, 300mgs of caffeine and no sugar so no sugar crash. About one of the only energy drinks that don’t make me anxious. Good price at the moment, about $2 a can Read more | 5.0\nIf you're looking for a fitness drink that combines stellar performance benefits with a burst of flavor, Reign Total Body Fuel in Razzle Berry is a game-changer. This drink stands out in the crowded market of sports beverages for several reasons. First off, the taste is incredible. Razzle Berry offers a vibrant and refreshing flavor that makes staying hydrated an enjoyable experience. It's sweet but not overpoweringly so, and it has a pleasant berry blend that isn’t too artificial. You’ll find yourself looking forward to your workout just for the chance to enjoy this drink. On the performance side, Reign Total Body Fuel delivers. With its blend of natural caffeine from coffee beans and BCAAs, it provides a steady energy boost without the jitters or crashes associated with some other pre-workout drinks. The electrolytes and vitamins included help with hydration and recovery, ensuring you stay at the top of your game throughout your exercise routine. What’s also impressive is the zero sugar content. Reign manages to keep the flavor punchy and satisfying without any added sugars, making it a great choice for those watching their calorie intake or managing their sugar levels. The can design is sleek and modern, which makes it a great companion for both the gym and your daily routine. Plus, the portability is a huge plus—whether you're heading to a workout session or just need a pick-me-up, it's easy to grab and go. In summary, Reign Total Body Fuel Razzle Berry is more than just a tasty drink; it's a performance-enhancing powerhouse that delivers on its promises. It's the perfect choice for anyone looking to boost their energy, stay hydrated, and enjoy a deliciously refreshing beverage. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\nThis is a fantastic price and every single can was sealed and drinkable, no leaks or anything, however they were all dented. I wondered if that's why the price was good, but i don't think that's it. Anytime you're buying in bulk the price should be a good deal less than in store retail pricing on a single can. But.... I had to wounder... every single can dented? Bad enough for me to be surprised that none of them busted open and leaked. But again, they all stayed sealed. Taste fantastic and otherwise as expected. I've already placed a second order and will continue buying them here as long as it's available. Would be moronic to buy anywhere else at this point. Read more | 5.0\nEl mejor sabor! | 5.0",

Read more | 5.0\nI have been ordering Monster off Amazon for a couple of years now. Amazon is by far the best price and the only place I can purchase a 15 pack of Monster. I have gotten Monster for under 2.00 a can by purchasing the sugar free flavors that are under $30. All of the flavors are decent, I’d have to say I lean more towards the berry flavors with Strawberry dreams being my favorite. But all Monster’s  have a crisp refreshing taste to them. The biggest and only problem I run into with purchasing Monster through Amazon is, the package have been damaged in the past. Very few cans have been dented. I have only had 3 cans ever be delivered that were not full and that was not Amazons fault it was a manufacturing error. These can’s were not dented, no holes were in these can’s, the top’s had not be opened at all. They were simply not filled correctly through the Monster warehouse. I never contacted Amazon about the 3 particular damaged cans or any of the damaged boxes. I did try to reach out to Monster and it was far too complicated to do so. They only allow you to contact them via their page that has particular options on how, what and where you purchased your Monster product.  purchasing a 15 pack of Monster through Amazon are not options. I also struggled with seeing  some of the information Monster requires off the can that is damaged. All in all I would recommend to anyone who drinks Monster on a regular basis for their daily boost of energy to purchase through Amazon. Read more | 5.0\nI purchased the Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango Sugar Free for my son, who needs a boost of energy but can't have the sugar. This drink is exactly what we were looking for! The flavor is delicious and refreshing, with a nice tropical mango taste that isn't too overpowering. It's sweetened just enough to make it enjoyable, but without any of the sugar that would normally be a concern. The energy boost is noticeable, and it helps my son stay focused and alert without any jitters or crashes, which can sometimes happen with other energy drinks. Plus, it's a great option for anyone looking to avoid sugar but still need that pick-me-up. Overall, I highly recommend Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango for anyone who needs an energy boost but wants to keep things sugar-free. It’s a win-win! Read more | 5.0\nI have tried EVERY flavor of Monster Zero Ultra and overall, love this product, love the taste, and love that it's sugar-free and only 10 calories THAT BEING SAID, not every flavor is created equal. The BEST flavors of Monster Ultra are... -Paradise (green can, tastes like green Jolly Ranchers) -Sunrise (orange, tastes like Sunny D but carboated) -Watermelon -Peachy Keen (this one is so friggin good, it's crazy how good it is) The WORST flavors are... -Fiesta Mango! Stay away from this one! It tastes so bad, it tastes like how a hair salon smells when someone gets their hair permed! -Red (It's just not very good, just has a very vague flavor). -Black (Also just not very good, tastes like cough medicine) But for real though, do NOT get the Fiesta Mango.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to! The flavor is AMAZING! Energy is AMAZING! And it’s perfect for someone on keto looking for an energy boost! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n1.0\n4.0",

    "reviews": "ZERO Variety Pack Variety Pack Punch Variety Pack ZERO Wild Strawberry Watermelon ZERO Wild Ruby Red ZERO Wild Berry Yerba Mate Tropical Punch Peach Mango Original Lite Fruit Punch ZERO Wild Ice Pop Love these flavors! Caffeine content just right for me. I only drink half a can a day and it supplies enough energy to get me going on days I don’t have time to make coffee Read more | 5.0\nTastes good, quality ingredients and kept me awake to finish term papers overnight. Read more | 5.0\nIf you're anything like me, you have a busy life, and getting 8+ hours of sleep every night just doesn't happen. You need something to get through your day, and the proliferation of mass-market energy drinks has led you to chugging one, two, three or even more in a day! Not good! I know my own Bed Rull (clever!) drinking was getting out-of-control, and it was having a serious impact on both my health and my wallet. In my desperation for a source of healthier, more cost and eco friendly energy, I turned to my local natural grocery store and found this: GURU Lite. Made with Stevia instead of all those \"let's all wait for the news story about the horrible health impacts\" artificial sweeteners, and containing only ingredients you can actually pronounce (sparking water, lemon juice, cane juice, guarana seed, luo han gua juice, steevia, echinacea, ginko, ginseng)it sounded pretty promising. But what about the energy? Well it works, I took my first sip, went \"oh well, crap, doesn't work\" and then 2 minutes later I was awake! No jitters, no \"surge-o-epic caffeine\" - just awake. It's refreshing, if you're used to the \"wired wired wired wired zing zoom bzzzzz crash!\" of normal energy drinks, get ready for one that actually just makes you feel like yourself. Not wired, not tired, not cranky, not crazy, just a couple extra hours of focus as YOU! But what about the flavor? GURU Lite is best described as \"not bad\", I like it room temperature, you may prefer it chilled. Unlike those commercial heart-attacks-in-a-can, GURU focused on health over sugar-load, so expect a slightly lemony, earthy herbal taste. It is not by an means bad tasting, but it's not like liquid candy, it's a simple, natural flavor that doesn't overwhelm or make you want to chug twenty of them. You drink this for the health and energy, and the taste is secondary. I don't want you to think \"oh it tastes bad...\" because it doesn't, it's just the taste is definitely not the focus, it's not a soda, it's more like a glass of water - you drink it because you're thirsty, and this, you drink because you are tired and want to be awake. What about the cost? Well, Amazon has the best deal around. I chose the subscribe-and-save option and came home to find a box, wrapped in a clear plastic wrap to protect against rain, two days later. Inside was my case of GURU (which looks exactly like the picture). I found with GURU not only am I drinking fewer of them than I did with Bed Rull, but I'm able to sleep better and of course I'm ending each month with tons of cash in my pocket that is no longer being spent on over-priced, junk-laden commercial \"energy\". And the best part? I have all the energy I want at hand in a far, far healthier package. Give it a shot today, you will be pleasantly surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI don’t typically like sparkling drinks. They are hard to drink. They tend to make me feel bloated, and usually they taste terrible because they’re meant to be on the lighter side, calorie wise. For example, Celsius sparkling drinks. I LOVE the non carbonates drinks they make! But the sparkling/carbonation side of them make them hard to enjoy, and the taste is not as good as their non carbonated drinks. If you’ve tried them, you know what I mean. These drinks are also sparkling, but somehow they aren’t as “carbonated” feeling and tasting! Impressive! They have a perfect balance for that effect. Makes it easier to chug when I’m in a hurry. Was also worried about the taste! I’ve never tasted Yerba mate, so I was expecting a very strong earthy taste. It mostly taste like a delicate mint taste with a mild “artificial” sweetening aftertaste and a hint of tea. Seriously impressed. Usually when you see all these healthier ingredients you know it’s good for you, or better for you anyways, but you know it’s probably not going to taste very good. One example of a “lighter” drink such as this one, or similar anyways as far as the use of “better ingredients” in the product, is the jocko willink energy drink. In the ingredients list, you will see things that will make you feel better about drinking the product. But it doesn’t taste good at all. This drink has great ingredients and balanced use of them to give it just enough taste and carbonation, to enjoy. I’m amazed with this product and will buy two more of these cases. I regret not getting the variety packs at sams when they did carry them, because I want to try the other flavors. Give these a shot if you so t mins a light tasting, light carbonation effect energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI wasted $50.00 on an unsuspecting change in recipe that showed up at my door.  The GURU original use to be AMAZING, now it takes like overly sweet artificial crap.  There was no warning on this change, so BEWARE.

The drink is smooth and the flavor is a classic one.  It don't have a bad aftertaste either. I love that it comes in a 20oz can. Most drinks aren't that big.  By being so big, i can set it down  in the fridge and come back to it and be able to have a nice drink to sip on all day!  The can itself is appealing and discreet.  I looooove that it comes sugar free!  Some of the other energy drinks have a poor flavor  or aftertaste in their sugar free options.  Red Bull Sugar Free Energy Drink with 189mg Caffeine plus Taurine & B Vitamins tastes just as good as the full flavor drinks in my opinion. After pricing the energy drinks out there that don't have any sugar, I was happy to see that these were a better deal than most other sugar free energy drink options! You really can't beat Red Bull Sugar Free Energy Drink with 189mg Caffeine plus Taurine & B Vitamins.  They come in big cans- and in a 12 pack!! You can sip on these babies for weeks with one pack!

Around that mid-afternoon slump, when my focus starts to disappear, cracking open one of these gives me just the right boost to power through the rest of the day. The 80mg of caffeine hits the sweet spot—not too much, not too little—and I like that it’s sugar-free, so I don’t crash later. I’ve tried other sugar-free energy drinks, but they either taste weirdly artificial or leave me jittery. This one just works. It’s crisp, refreshing, and predictable in the best way. Plus, I’ll admit, there’s something oddly satisfying about that pssst when you open the can. It’s definitely become part of my routine. My coworkers even joke that they know it’s 2:30 when they hear that familiar sound from my desk. If you need a reliable energy boost without the sugar overload, this one’s hard to beat.

    "reviews": "Wild Berry Summertime Watermelon Strawberry Lemonade Strawberry Banana Diet Strawberry Lemonade Blueberry Pomegranate Black Cherry Pomegranate Blueberry Orange Pineapple Peach Mango I absolutely love the V8 +Energy Pomegranate Blueberry! The flavor is refreshing and not too sweet, with a perfect blend of pomegranate and blueberry. Unlike other energy drinks, this one provides a steady energy boost from natural black and green tea, so there’s no jittery crash later. I also appreciate that it contains veggies and vitamins, making it a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks. The 8 fl oz size is just right for me and the 24-pack is a great value for those who drink these regularly. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a delicious, lightly caffeinated drink to keep you energized throughout the day! I have these on monthly subscription and will definitely be continuing to purchase. Read more | 5.0\nI've unfortunately been drinking zero-calorie Monsters daily for close to a decade. Between the cost and the possible health impacts (including the presence of sugar alcohol erithrytol, which may have metabolic syndrome effects), I've finally been seeking alternatives. But what to drink? You start looking at alternatives, and every energy drink is either equally garbage or even worse - twice as much caffeine, tons of calories, or just plain terrible flavor. These V8's have a respectable list of healthy ingredients, a small number of calories, no artificial sweeteners, and only 80mg of caffeine to the 160mg of a Monster or the 300mg of a Bang, which is useful for dialing in and reducing my caffeine intake. They're half the size but only cost a third as much as other energy drinks. They're an easy, smooth, tasty drink that's healthier and more affordable. I'm enjoying them a lot. And my wife (who has been hounding me about energy drinks for years) is happy with it too. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the V8 Fruit-Flavored Juice, and I must say, it’s a delightful treat! 🍹 The packaging is sleek and easy to pour, ensuring no spills.

The strawberry flavor is light and fruity, and it’s packed with natural caffeine from green tea for a clean, sustained energy boost. At 8 fl oz per can, it’s the perfect size for on-the-go hydration. The limited edition flavor makes it a fun, seasonal treat. A great choice for a quick pick-me-up without the crash! 🍓⚡✨ Read more | 5.0\nI have to start by saying that I am not a fan of caffeine booster drinks or energy drinks. But, this one is my favorite.

    "reviews": "Zero Sugar Grape Original Okay, let me just say: NOS Zero Sugar High Performance Energy Drinks are like a turbo boost for your body. I cracked one open, took a sip, and suddenly felt like I could run a marathon, solve a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded, and maybe even convince my cat to stop knocking things off the counter— all at once. The energy hit me like a lightning bolt, but without the crash afterward, which is basically a miracle in a can. The best part? Zero sugar. So I get all the wild energy with none of the guilt. It’s like drinking pure motivation, but without that sugar-induced mid-afternoon nap. I’ve had coffee, I’ve had Red Bull, but NOS? NOS is like if rocket fuel and a power-up from Mario Kart had a baby. You’ll be getting things done that you didn’t even know you could do—like finally cleaning out that junk drawer. Taste-wise, it’s smooth, not overly sweet, and gives you that “I’m about to crush this day” feeling with every sip. Highly recommend for anyone who needs a boost that’s not going to turn them into a jittery mess, and definitely for anyone who wants to channel their inner superhero without the cape. Bottom line: If you need energy, NOS Zero Sugar is basically your cheat code for life. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve always loved the original NOS energy drink, and when the zero sugar version came out, it was a game-changer!

If you’re a fan of NOS and looking for a zero-sugar option that doesn’t compromise on taste or performance, this is a fantastic choice. Highly recommend!

The flavor is like a fruity, sparkling party in a can—perfectly sweet with no sugar and no weird aftertaste. It’s hard to describe the flavor exactly, but it feels like a mix of berry and grape with a fun, cosmic twist. What’s even better is that it gives me the energy I need without the crash. I drink it in the afternoon for a pick-me-up, and it keeps me going through work or a workout. The fact that it’s sugar-free makes it guilt-free too! The packaging is super cute and eye-catching, and the carbonation level is just right—not too fizzy, not flat. I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious and refreshing energy drink.

The Alani Energy Drinks are my new go-to for a quick pick-me-up.

I’ve also tried the Alani Pre-Workout, and it delivers on all fronts—great taste, increased energy, and enhanced focus during my workouts. I love how it’s packed with ingredients that actually make a difference in my performance, plus it doesn’t upset my stomach like some other pre-workouts do. What I really appreciate is how Alani uses high-quality, transparent ingredients with no artificial junk. Plus, their products are all about supporting a healthy lifestyle, which resonates with me.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Bundle C4 Smart Energy Official Variety Pack Watermelon Burst Tropical Passion-fruit Strawberry Guava Peach Mango Nectar Cherry Berry Lime Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Yuzu Black Cherry Berry Breeze Variety Pack C4 Brain & Body Official Variety Pack Tropical Oasis Variety Pack The media could not be loaded. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost. I still prefer Rockstar or Monster overall. Read more | 4.0\nCellucor is the best energy drink on the market.  The flavors are great, and just the right amount of energy.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Strawberry Watermelon Raspberry Lemon Orange Cherry Lime Peach Mango THE BEST ENERGY DRINKS I HAVE EVER HAD!!!  These have to be the best drinks made. They have a great taste. Do not give off the gross and chemically energy drink flavor. Variety packs allows for a nice switch of drinks. Worth the money, would spend close to $50 for the same amount of monster energy drinks. Doesnt give you the jittery feeling other drinks do. Love the health benefits such as the metabolism booster, natural caffine and low calories. Read more | 5.0\nI'm an energy drink lover and really didn't want to like these drinks. I thought they were overrated and not worth trying. I WAS WRONG. They truly taste amazing, the raspberry lemonade is so good. The caffeine content is great, keeps me going with no jitters and no crashing and CLEAN ingredients. If you are an energy drink lover that needs the drinks to function, try these out! Read more | 5.0\nLet me tell you! I've been an energy drink consumer for years and bloom has been a game changer for me! Not only are they the right price but they give me twice the energy boost over a rebull with zero crash. They also taste refreshing with zero fake additive aftertaste which is a big plus because thar aftertaste can get to ya after awhile. I have made the 100% switch to bloom from redbull. Loving the peach mango as my #1 go to with strawberry watermelon as my close runner up! Excited to see if any new flavors come out here in the near future. Buy a case you will not be disappointed at all!! Read more | 5.0\nI am absolutely loving Bloom Sparkling Energy Drink! It’s the perfect pick-me-up with natural caffeine and zero sugar, so I get the energy boost I need without the crash or jitters. The 180mg of caffeine is just the right amount to keep me focused and alert throughout the day. The taste is crisp and refreshing, and I really appreciate that it’s antioxidant-rich—a nice bonus for a healthier energy drink option. Plus, no artificial aftertaste like some other brands! If you’re looking for a clean, delicious, and effective energy drink, Bloom is a fantastic choice. Read more | 5.0\nThese drinks provide me with great energy and have great flavor (peach mango and raspberry lemon are my fav). I wish they would formulate 1-2 flavors with out sucralose (monk fruit ideally) for those of us who are health/ingredient conscious. 180 mg is a lot of caffeine for myself, i wish they had the half can option (like alani nu) for when someone just needs a little boost, wants the energy in the afternoon, or for those who are caffeine sensitive. Overall i much prefer this brand to other brands, however i would not drink them daily due to their limitations. Read more | 4.0\nThis was my first time trying bloom. I got the variety pack and every flavor is so good! It also helps my digestion and gives me a good amount of energy. Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love this variety pack. I recently discovered these as an energy drink option, and I immediately loved the two flavors I tried (Juicy Orange and Strawberry Watermelon), so I wanted to try some others! The other three flavors in this pack do not disappoint! I was worried they would taste like the bloom greens drinks, but they do not! No greens flavor here, just fruity and delicious. They have 180mg of caffeine from natural sources and zero sugar, both wins in my book! Read more | 5.0\nI just love the taste of cherry lime Bloom sparkling energy and it gives me a \"lift\"! The price is saving me money, so it's a win win! Read more | 5.0",

The taste is fantastic—flavorful and not overly sweet like some other brands. They do exactly what they promise: keep me awake and alert without a jittery crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash.

It is definitely worth ordering these off of Amazon as the price is unbeatable anywhere else. If they have a sale, buy a pack or two.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Bundle C4 Smart Energy Official Variety Pack Watermelon Burst Tropical Passion-fruit Tropical Oasis Variety Pack Strawberry Guava Peach Mango Nectar Cherry Berry Lime Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Yuzu Black Cherry Berry Breeze Variety Pack C4 Brain & Body Official Variety Pack The media could not be loaded. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up.

    "reviews": "Sparkling Orangesicle Sparkling Mango Tango Sparkling Fruit Burst Sparkling Dragonberry Sparkling Cherry Limeaid Sparkling Blue Crush Celsius is the \"healthiest\" energy drink brand you can buy, aside from Yerba (I know energy drinks are NOT healthy, but I mean- no dyes, healthy ingredients, no sugar, no FAKE sugars, etc. I am a manager at a health food store, and we sell 'em.) I got this entire case of Celsius for only $8... On a Flash Deal... It was an INSANE deal. I never would've tried these, (because I'm not a fan of sparkling water) BUT I have to say they tasted pretty darn good! Not my first pick, but even at full price they come to about $1.83 a can which is slightly cheaper than if you were to buy them elsewhere. The flavor is reminiscent of an orange creamsicle and is very light. My husband and I both enjoyed them, and he isn't a fan of orange creamsicle (unlike me.) There's no sugar as I stated, the can is bigger than the normal Celsius, and they work just as good if not better. I actually lost a lot of weight drinking Celsius and following my Plant Based diet, it helps speed up a slower metabolism. Definitely try them if they're on sale, but before buying an entire case, I'd recommend testing out a single one first of course. Don't commit to a large quantity of something based off of a review made by someone who got a case of these for eight bucks. Would I buy it full price? Probably, but I may choose a different flavor. Flavor is like 6/10. By the way, have you ever tried Ghost Energy brand? That one is a 10/10. Read more | 5.0\nThis is my favorite flavor of Celsius. The price was good for these as it was cheaper than the local grocery store. They arrived quickly and undamaged. These help me get through the day, the caffeine content isn't as much as other drinks so I don't feel jittery. And the taste is good doesn't have a fake sugar taste to it. Celsius is my go to brand of energy drink since it doesn't upset my stomach like others do. Read more | 5.0\nI usually drink energy drinks before every workout, and I've tried probably every energy drink out there. In terms of taste, this orangesicle is probably on par with the Reign orange cream, but this definitely packs a heavier punch. Each of these cans have 270mg caffeine and most of the times, I'll just drink half and stick the other half in the fridge. This is definitely my favorite so far and a must for days I'm looking for a good pump or if I'm just feeling groggy and tired. Read more | 5.0\nThis Celsius Energy drink is great! Make sure you have a supply of it. I order it my the case. I start my morning out with this Celsius drink. It’s reasonably priced if you buy it by the case from Amazon! Read more | 5.0\nWas hoping for a different flavor but this one works for me. Like sugar content and taste Read more | 4.0\nBy far my favorite Celsius flavor though they just came out with a Grape Slush one I enjoy.  Packed full of vitamins, caffeine, and great taste.  Has a little more than a typical 200mg of caffeine, but they energy it supplies sustains for a good amount of time Read more | 5.0\nGreat price, 270 mg caffeine. It did have a sweeter flavor but still good. Read more | 5.0\nAmong the various energy drinks my friends and coworkers experiment with, such as Ghost and C4, I firmly believe Celsius stands out as the superior choice. Celsius is unique in that it has university studies backing its claims. These studies demonstrate that its thermogenesis effect enhances metabolism, and its ingredients are safe for consumption. As a fitness enthusiast who frequently visits the gym, I find Celsius Essentials to be an indispensable companion. Its combination of energy-boosting properties and gentle impact on the body make it the ideal partner for my workouts. I always ensure I have a Celsius with me to sustain my energy levels and maintain my body's well-being. In my opinion, Celsius Essentials is the ultimate fitness partner. Its ability to motivate and energize me during workouts sets it apart from other products. I am confident that I will never find another energy drink that inspires and supports my fitness journey as effectively as Celsius Essentials. Celsius offers a delightful selection of flavors, natural ingredients, and premium caffeine sources. Its beverages are devoid of any medicinal aftertaste. Celsius has truly mastered the art of flavor creation. In particular, stands out with its refreshing, smooth, and slightly creamy texture. It captures the essence of genuine fruits, avoiding the artificial flavors often associated with candy or medicine. I am captivated by this flavor and eagerly anticipate future orders.

They taste good with a little boost of caffeine. Read more | 5.0\nCrisp, well balanced flavor.  A good mix of tea and lemonade with the added caffeine for a nice pick up.

Read more | 5.0\nWe have tried so many energy drinks out there, but we keep coming back to these! Just the right amount of caffeine coming in at 70mg. All the flavors are great (citrus is our favorite) and the carbonation is just like a soda. But let’s talk about value… so many energy drinks out there are expensive. You can get 12 cans anywhere from $16-$22!!! I mean come on, you can’t beat that!! I would HIGHLY recommend these as your choice of an energy boost through your day! Read more | 5.0\nThese taste like mixing a lot of cotton candy with a little lemon juice and adding carbonation.. but I’m not mad about that. It tastes pretty good. Oddly enough, it has less caffeine than many competitors, and although it doesn’t claim to give me wings, I find it gives me more energy? It’s stacked with B vitamins too though, and that may make a difference. I do notice that my heart started racing a little while I was drinking one of these the other night and it got me a little nervous, but I still finished it and worked my 12 hour overnight shift without an issue. All in all, I think this was worth it. Read more | 4.0\nI love these drinks, especially the blue raspberry flavor, the carbonation is perfectly crispy and so satisfying. I used to guzzle down 64oz of Dr. Pepper everyday and these helped me to kick to the habit, no sugar and less caffeine. Absolutely perfect for your emotional support drink :p Read more | 5.0\nI like this flavor and content of caffeine without having to drink soda to get my caffeine intake.

    "reviews": "Rehab Strawberry Lemonade Rehab Peach Rehab Lemonade Lemonade Tea Lemon variety Wild berry tea Strawberry Lemonade Rehab Watermelon Peach Tea Tea + Lemonade I really enjoy Monster Energy overall, so when my roommate wanted to try this flavor I was really into the idea. They arrived quickly with Prime membership and no extra shipping cost, Woot🥳 I couldn’t wait so I popped the can so quick, even room temperature The Monster Energy Recovery Peach Tea Edition was very flavorful and refreshing and I thought of drinking a cold Monster Peach Tea bathing in the warm glow of SUNLIGHHHHT!!! So, I waited super impatiently to try one cold and it was so, so good! Even more refreshing because it was a really hot day even inside. I felt energized but not at all jittery or dehydrated, it seemed to me like a really positive alternative to sugary or super carbonated drinks! I love that Monster is venturing out into so many flavor options as well as varieties to offer something for each persons preference for every occasion and I am super excited about the Recovery Teas, I will definitely buy them again! The price is really fair especially considering they are shipped to your front door without having to pay extra for delivery if you’re an Amazon Prime Member, without lugging the extra weight around and in out of the car is nice, the availability is choice, and it saves on tipping if money is tight for other delivery services. I think you should definitely try them if you are a fan of peach teas and a great cerebral and altogether physical boost with the possibility it will curb major side effects some energy drinks may cause in certain people!! Thanks for checking out my review, I drank them all before I got to the review! Lol!! Sorry for the missing picture :) Have a great Monster Energy Day, I know I’m going to!! (Typically more caffeine than some others in their regular versions, not sure on this one) Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who’s always on the go and looking for a better pick-me-up, the Monster Energy Rehab Tea + Lemonade + Energy has quickly become my go-to energy drink. It's the perfect combination of flavor, hydration, and energy boost without feeling overwhelming. Pros: Great taste and balance: The tea and lemonade blend is spot on. It has a refreshing, slightly sweet flavor with a tangy lemonade kick. Unlike some other energy drinks that can taste overly artificial or too sweet, this one feels light and smooth. Perfect for sipping throughout the day. Gentle energy boost: The energy boost is noticeable but doesn’t feel jittery or overwhelming. It gives me just the right amount of alertness to power through long workdays or workouts, but without the crash that some stronger energy drinks can cause. I can have one in the morning and still feel good in the afternoon. Low calories: With only 25 calories per can, it’s a great option for those looking to cut down on sugary, high-calorie drinks but still want that refreshing taste and energy. I love that I can enjoy it guilt-free. Cons: Larger cans: At 15.5oz per can, it’s a bit larger than the standard energy drink size. While I personally like the extra volume, some people might find it too much to finish in one go. If you don’t drink it all at once, make sure to refrigerate the can to keep it fresh. Not as strong as other energy drinks: If you’re looking for a more intense energy rush, this might not be for you. It’s more of a steady, sustained boost rather than the rapid jolt you get from other energy drinks like Monster’s regular line or stronger competitors. Overall Experience: Monster Rehab has been a game-changer for me. It’s not only a great energy drink, but it also doubles as a refreshing tea-lemonade hybrid. It’s perfect for days when I want to stay energized and hydrated without feeling bogged down by too much sugar or caffeine. I find myself reaching for this after a workout or when I need a midday pick-me-up without worrying about crashing later. Tips for Use: Chill for the best flavor: It tastes best when it’s ice-cold, so I recommend refrigerating it before drinking. Perfect for outdoor activities: The tea and lemonade combo makes it an ideal drink to take with you when you’re out in the sun. Whether you're at a BBQ, hiking, or just lounging at the park, it’s refreshing and keeps you going. --- Overall, Monster Energy Rehab Tea + Lemonade is a fantastic option for those who want a refreshing, low-calorie drink with just the right amount of energy boost. It's perfect for anyone who enjoys iced tea but wants a little extra kick to keep them going throughout the day.

The green tea is the all-around top notch. Best flavor out is the strawberry lemonade it is not over sweet not tart it's just right and approved by my primary and cardiologist as well. The monster rehabs helped me recover when I was going through chemotherapy. I was able to keep my weight up and my energy up and my doctors were astounded by the results of my labs!

I love anything that is blueberry, blackberry, or sort of tangy tasting and these are so good and tangy. Second- they are the perfect size. I used to drink rockstars and they were simply too big and I could never finish a full can so it would just be wasted. Because it would be flat later on or the next morning. You can actually leave these Reb bulls sitting out all day and they don’t go flat. Third- the price is decent. They end up being about $1.67 per drink as of this time. That’s not too bad for an energy drink in my opinion. Last of all, they are a slightly yellow/clear color and do not stain your teeth. I used to be obsessed with fruit punch rockstars and they were bright red. I had to quit drinking them because they were staining my teeth. So I appreciate the fact that these are clear with just a slight yellowish tinge and do not stain my teeth. Read more | 5.0\nNot only do they taste great, but getting them delivered is so easy.

Read more | 5.0\nRed Bull has been my go-to energy drink for years, and this 24-pack is a convenient and cost-effective way to keep a steady supply on hand. Taste: The classic Red Bull flavor is unique – a blend of sweetness and tartness with a slight medicinal note. It's definitely an acquired taste, but I personally enjoy it. The carbonation adds a refreshing kick, and the 8.4 fl oz size is perfect for a quick boost without feeling overwhelmed. Effectiveness: Red Bull is known for its ability to provide a quick burst of energy, and it delivers on that promise. The combination of caffeine, taurine, and B vitamins helps me power through long workdays, workouts, or late-night study sessions. I notice a significant improvement in my focus and alertness within minutes of drinking it. Ingredients: While Red Bull is effective, it's important to be mindful of the ingredients. It does contain a significant amount of sugar and caffeine, so moderation is key. I wouldn't recommend drinking it every day, but it's a great option for occasional use when you need an extra boost. Packaging: The 24-pack is great for stocking up. The cans are sturdy and easy to transport, and the packaging keeps them fresh. Overall: If you're looking for a reliable energy drink that delivers a noticeable energy boost, Red Bull is a solid choice. The 24-pack is a convenient and cost-effective option, and while the taste might not be for everyone, the effectiveness is undeniable. Just be sure to consume it in moderation due to the sugar and caffeine content. Read more | 5.0\nFull price it's way too expensive online, I usually get this in wal-mart where it's half the price.

Honestly the only sugar free energy drink we can tolerate, much better cold, but I REALLY need a large dose of caffeine and I need to drop the sugar. We like a variety of flavors, but find some of them they can make our stomachs hurt if we drink them daily, our go to is peach mango (which is NOT what I would have guessed for me, lol), but we like the strawberry, blue raspberry, cotton candy, birthday cake the best, and the purple haze isn't bad, the sour flavors....forget it, lol, my old stomach can't. Bang honestly is the best energy drink I have tried. It doesn't usually give me the jitters, it doesn't usually make me crash (unless I drink the whole thing really fast for some reason or I am having a particularly bad day), it tastes MILES better than anything else sugar free....all the orders have arrived in tact, and I don't have to worry about having to track down an energy drink from every grocery store/gas station like some sort of crazy person...I ain't got the time...I just need large quantities of caffeine to function because of health problems, lol.

Read more | 5.0\nPackage broken Read more | 4.0\nI am an avid energy drink connoisseur and have been since around 2005.  Granted at that time there was very little in the market, but out of the three major brands back then: Monster, Red Bull, and Rockstar, Monster won hands down.  The original flavor with the green top has been their staple drink.  But as I became a bit more sugar-minded and aware, I looked for alternatives in the zero-sugar category. Monster Absolute Zero is the drink of choice for me.  It gives that same familiar taste as the original just with a slightly toned down sugar hit.  The drink itself is very different than its competitors, and it is by far the most flavorful out of any that I've tried.  I limit myself to one a day and that allows me to get my fix in. I will say, I don't get \"energy\" from the drink, but I don't from any of them to be frank.  It's about the flavor for me, which is why I still drink it. Anyways, as far as bang for your buck, this is by far the best deal you're going to get.  Sure, Costco and Sams club have the 24 packs, but they don't sell this version.  I was going to the gas station every day to buy one or two, and it would cost either $3.50 for 1 or $6.00 for two (plus tax).  At $1.87 a can by buying this 15 pack, you end up saving a ton.  I buy two at the start of the month and it's just been super convenient to just pull one out of the fridge to start the day.  Sure, you pay a bit more on the front end, but yearly savings for me by doing it this was comes to approximately $400.00 at least.  I wish I would have thought of this sooner! Read more | 5.0",

Read more | 5.0\nThis has been a particular favorite between my wife, teenage daughter, and I for a while.  We ended up getting it from Amazon since a lot of local places around us stopped carrying it. It taste more like a fruity drink over an energy drink, and is really nice and tasty when you have it closer to frozen temperature wise.  Very easy to go down and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste.  It is a little syrupy sweet, but nothing strong like Mountain Dew.  We actually prefer this one to the whipped orange, which sadly doesn't hit the nostalgia of a creamsicle bar as I was hoping it would. When we first had this on Subscribe and Save it was $15.99 for a pack of 12, so the prices seem to roughly close to the same.  The value is buying it in bulk, as an individual one of these is $2.49 at our local Kroger, so you are pretty much paying a little over less than a dollar each, which for 12 cans is pretty significant. Read more | 5.0\nDon't get me wrong, I bought this purely to support RockStar energy (I also bought the OG throwback to compare) but the OG flavor was truly better. I remember back In the days (when Rockstar was the first energy drink in the USA) that was my go to. Over Redbull, monster, Nos etc. Then they changed the \"formula\" to what is now called \"original\" and honestly I have no idea why. That made me stop drinking Rockstar for so long, I ended up converting to a NoS drinker then a Monster energy drinker. Thankfully they brought back the OG flavor with the \"throwback\" version and all I can say is KEEP THAT VERSION PERMANENTLY! They really are different and where I'm honestly just too old to vividly remember the \"taste\" of the actual OG Rockstar (to like, compare it to this \"throwback\" version) and I'm not LA beast over there drinking outdated \"vintage\" products just to \"remember\" them lol. I can definitely say that the OG one definitely reminded me of the OG flavor (hence it's name) and it definitely is a different taste than the \"now original\" flavor. So 4/5 I still support RockStar, it was the first energy drink I even fell in love with and picked over all the rest but I just don't agree with the \"change\", hence my 4/5. 5/5 for the OG flavor. Get throw back OG version, Rockstar, keep that version permanent, that's how you get OG fans back to being loyal to your drink over the rest. Facts. I'll be buying plenty more OG Throwback versions. No \"hate\" on the \"original\" i just don't person get the \"change\". I personally prefer/ed the OG flavor. Read more | 4.0\nI love the rock star energy drinks. I love the red one, and this one the gold. They taste good, and they really do give you a good energy. I would have posted a picture of them, but I drank them so quick. I couldn't take a picture. They're all gone, I'll have to order more. Read more | 5.0\nGlad that I'm able to buy this flavor of Rockstar on Amazon because I'm not able to find it locally anymore. The price per can is on par with what it would cost at a local grocery store or gas station. Read more | 5.0\nI love the taste and energy boost from Rockstar Sugar Free—it's a fantastic drink that keeps me going throughout the day. The sleek 12oz cans are the perfect size, and the 8-pack is super convenient. However, the packaging could use some improvement. The plastic wrapping around the pack was damaged when it arrived, which made me a bit concerned about the cans inside. Fortunately, they were intact, but better care during packing or shipping would make for a better overall experience. Still, the drink itself is excellent, so I’m giving it 4 stars. Just a little extra attention to packaging would make it perfect! Read more | 4.0",

The Mango Loco is very good if you like mango, it has a very natural flavor to it, nothing too artificial. The Pipeline Punch is probably my new favorite energy drink flavor, period.

Read more | 5.0\nHello and Good Evening, Seeing as my heart may not take another opening of this can. I must warn the others! The first time I opened this drink I was in the car, and opened it the next thing I know half of the can has spewed and overflowed from the can and onto to me, my car, and my wife. My wife and I were on our way to an all day event, and I HAD TO BORROW A STRANGE MANS UNDERWEAR! Due to mine be soaked, because apparently I was not informed that I would need a poncho in order to consume this beverage. Not a good day. 2nd Can - Thinking that it was just the one can, the next day I go to enjoy another refreshing can in my home this time. As I’m opening the can, SURPRISE!!! Half of the can is has again imploded and started spewing and overflowing in my kitchen. Again. To my dismay, this time without wet trousers. I clean the mess and move on. 3rd can - Thinking I have this figured out. I proceeded  to put the can into a larger cup thinking well if it’s going to spew over might as well catch it. Crack the can and this time it sprays. Like the turning on of a sprinkler. As a Result: I am only opening these cans with the proper safety measures in place. In the outdoors with a cup to catch the overflow to avoid any more SPILLAGE. And a poncho for the splash zone. As a Positive this is well packaged and well shipped energy drink I have bought. This Energy drink in my opinion is definitely the most PRESSURIZED drink I have consumed to date. As I wish to drink these and not strap them to my back and shoot to the Moon Alice. Read more | 1.0\nI wanted to like these because they had some interesting flavors.  Most of them you can’t tell a difference between the flavors.  The sour punch sour apple was awful, I ended up dumping it out.  Disappointing because I had high hopes Read more | 3.0\n***Update: Blue Raspberry Sour Punch is over-pressurized!!*** I’ve tried opening it cold, warm, after sitting for hours, etc. nothing changes. I still have to open it over the sink, with a wide-mouthed cup under it. It’s was an intermittent problem before, but it’s been every one in this case so far. I enjoy the flavor, but this is too inconvenient. All other flavors are great, I’m just going to stop ordering this flavor. I'm a fan of almost every flavor EXCEPT Baja Blast, Kool-Aid, Peach and Tiger's Blood. I alternate orders of the sour flavors (green apple and blue raspberry), a case lasts about a week in our house. This is really hard to come by in my area because no stores keep them in stock for long and the convenient stores mainly carry Monster, Ghost and C4, which are all too sweet for my liking. I've recommended Ryse to my family and friends, you could say I'm an unpaid ambassador! Get a colab pack and try a few, you'll be a convert too.

    "reviews": "caffeine,taurine sugar free not EXACTLY like the monster ultra but pretty dang close. it tstes great and has no sugar so whats not to hate. save a couple dollars on this and a good taste. win win. Read more | 5.0\nAll my past shipments have arrived intact. Drink tastes great. Costs less than name brand. This particular shipment had one 'exploded' can. Everything else intact if wet. Thank heavens this is surger free or it would be a sticky mess. 4 stars for experience in the past. Read more | 4.0\nThis is a great, more cost friendly option to Sugar Free Monster Ultra, the white cans everyone is familiar with. The flavor is pretty similar although maybe a touch more citrus flavor and a bit more sweet after taste. I absolutely LOVE Solimo Silver Energy Drink. I do hate typing that because it feels like I am saying, \"my positive feelings rate a 7.6 when consuming Generic Drink brand generic drink.\" Aside from that it is a solid product. 160 mg of caffeine, good flavor, not too much carbonation, and a pleasant aftertaste. Certainly worth a try for any Monster Ultra Drinkers and an out and out replacement for it in my fridge at home. Read more | 5.0\nThis energy drink is a bearable alternative to the leading brands, especially considering the low price. It's definitely more budget-friendly, but the taste leaves something to be desired. While it gets the job done in terms of providing energy, the flavor is not as enjoyable as others I've tried. I gave it a shot because of the price point, but I won't be purchasing it again. If you're looking for a functional, cost-effective option and aren't too picky about taste, it might be worth trying. For me, though, I'll stick to tastier options moving forward. Read more | 3.0\nIt's always a struggle to find cost-effective vices that offer the same taste and kick compared to the ones you're used to, but I was pleasantly surprised by this Solimo energy drink.  To me, the Solimo white can tastes almost identical to Monster Energy Zero Ultra (white frosted can), sweet but not overpowering and light-to-moderate carbonation.  Sweetener used is Erythritol, same as the Monster.  Energy blend is Caffeine with Niacin, Vitamins B6/B12, and guarana seed extract listed in the ingredients. I've heard the red cans taste like Red Bull, but I haven't confirmed that myself.  It's kinda obvious why the cans are named the way they are, but I think they (Amazon) could do with better marketing if they want to reach more than just regular drinkers of energy drinks. All in all, it's somewhat difficult to beat a 12-pack for $18, and 2 cases will get you through most of a month if you only drink 1 can a day.  Also saves me quite a few trips to the convenience store. Definitely give it a shot if you want to save some money, and watch out for the occasional dented cans from the carelessness of the delivery drivers.  At least where I'm at, Amazon is pretty good about rectifying issues like that. Read more | 5.0\nThese are my favorite energy drinks, I prefer the silver, but the red is also good. The carbonation isn’t too sharp, and the flavor isn’t too flavory - shout out to my neurospicy friends who will fully understand this. I think it tastes sorta grapefruity, but not too much. The silver tastes tangy, gives me the caffeine I need. I drink mine in my 40oz Stanley, over ice. Mixed with pineapple juice. Delicious. It sometimes goes out of stock, and that’s why I’d prefer you not buy it. High quality, big 16oz can size,  tastes wonderful. Gives you the energy boost you need to function. Read more | 5.0\nI'm addicted to Monster Ultra but tried this when it was out of stock. Flavor is not the same, this one has a distinct and strong fruit flavor to it, sorta peachy. It's still good, but not the same as Ultra. I still prefer Monster. Caffeine and other stuff seem nearly identical. Photo's show back of Ultra and Silver cans respectively. This is a pack of 12 whearas Monster comes in a pack of 15. When I do the math, they're virtually the same price per can. Given that there's no real savings to get this brand, I'll stick with Monster as I like the flavor better. Read more | 4.0\nThese are very good. I drink an energy drink a day, and unless you find a local deal, 18 USD for 12 energy drinks that don’t taste disgusting is good. If I had to give them a flavor similar to a different brand, it’s very similar to a 1:1 0 sugar White monster. It isn’t exact, but it’s good in its own way. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "I am writing this review for the V8 8 ounce can pack of 24 Prime every two week home delivery, with Pomegranate Blueberry flavor. First, All the V8 regular healthy energy drinks taste great to me.  However, Pomegranate blueberry seems to be the most popular flavor.  I have not met a person yet who doesn't like it.  Please remember though, this is a non-carbonated drink. Most popular energy drinks do have carbonation.  This Pomegranate Blueberry does not. This drink has 50 calories a can.  They typical non-diet red bull has 110 calories for the same size can. This does give me \"an up\" like it is supposed to.  However, I think because  the caffeine appears to be from green tea, it does not have the more extreme up's and downs that other energy drinks and coffee can give a person. So if you are looking to get \"super wired\" for an all-nighter.  This probably would not be the drink for you. Be careful in regards to buying V8! These drinks appear to have become so popular that V8 has released several different variations on this drink.  There is a diet, which has 15 to 20 calories, I believe, but is not nearly as tasty as this drink.  There are carbonated versions, too.  But once again, this V8 healthy Pomegranate energy drink is not carbonated and goes down very smooth.  I have never had a huge belch even when I chugged one. I am currently using the every two week delivery from Amazon Prime to obtain 24 cans per delivery.  The cost is actually a dollar more than purchasing the same amount from my local grocery store.  However, the extra dollar for the convenience is worth it. There often appears to be an extra delay of 2 to three days for us to receive the drinks.  So instead of receiving this every two weeks we seem to receive them every 18 days.  I am not sure why.  Perhaps it's related to Covid.  I would think it is because I live in kind of a rural area, but then again, other Amazon Prime stuff comes right on schedule, so perhaps it is because of something with a specific warehouse or the manufacturer.  If the delays are Covid related, I would think they would go away soon. Read more | 5.0\nFor an energy drink this is far and away from the norm. Tastes like fresh picked and squeezed minutes ago! Just enough natural caffeine from the tea, and not in a giant can! I can comfortably hold it with one hand! 👏 Read more | 5.0\nDelicious Read more | 5.0\nGreat product, great value and most of all the flavors are incredible!!!! Read more | 5.0\nTastes great and healthier than a regular energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI regularly order and drink these V8 energy juices if I want a cold, sweet alternative to my typical hot coffee or tea in the morning. It provides lots of quick energy (don't feel jittery unless I have a lot) and it helps raise my blood sugar to a comfortable level when I need it most. For the product itself, I would give it a perfect 5/5, HIGHLY recommend for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to Monster and Red Bull. However, I have consistently experienced damaged packaging when ordering through Amazon. In a pallet of 24 cans (4x6), I typically have 2-3 badly bent and/or ruptured, which often leaves the other cans sticky and foul-smelling from the spoiled juice that leaks from damaged cans. I advise anyone ordering these in bulk to carefully inspect each one, it's an absolute minefield of not knowing when you'll crack open a frosty can of rotten fruit juice. I have consistently experienced this issue after literal years of biweekly orders and frequently require refunds for damaged cans. If Amazon cannot figure out how to safely transport liquids for human consumption, they should not be shipping these at all. Read more | 4.0\nI love the flavor and the fact that it has just enough caffeine to get me through the morning. The fact that it has vegetable and fruits in the can is a big plus. Love it Read more | 5.0\nI love V8 energy! Pomegranate blueberry and peach mango are the best flavors and I have at least one a day, so I order them monthly. That being said, the shipping packaging/methods need to be re-evaluated. I've had multiple packages arrive with dented cans, but last month I had some that were crushed so much that they broke open, and my package today was filled with loose cans (they're very dented, but thankfully still intact).

    "reviews": "Hawaiian Shaved Ice Cosmic Stardust Cherry Slush Breezeberry Juicy Peach These are very good. I mix them in a 14oz  shaker bottle with plain water. They have a pleasant taste and have no sweetner or calories. They also have a pick me up of caffine. Perfict for on the go or I drink them in place of coffee in the morning. Read more | 5.0\nCherry Slush Flavor: The cherry slush flavor is undeniably amazing, delivering a burst of fruity sweetness reminiscent of a classic summer treat. Its vibrant taste and refreshing sensation make it a standout among the available options. With its bold flavor profile, it's sure to satisfy any craving for a deliciously icy beverage. Other Flavors: While the cherry slush flavor shines brightly, the same cannot be said for the other options in the lineup. Unfortunately, they fall short in terms of taste and may not be as enjoyable or satisfying. It's disappointing when the quality doesn't match up to the standout flavor, leaving much to be desired for those who prefer variety in their drink choices. Price Increase: One aspect that detracts from the overall experience is the price increase based on flavor popularity. It's understandable to adjust prices based on demand, but it can be frustrating for consumers who feel penalized for their preferred flavor choice. This pricing strategy may discourage exploration of other flavors and could lead to dissatisfaction among customers who feel limited by budget constraints. In summary, the cherry slush flavor drink mix offers a delightful taste experience that's unmatched by its counterparts. However, the disparity in flavor quality and the issue of price increases based on popularity detract from the overall appeal of the product line. Read more | 5.0\nThis is one of My favorite flavors for the Alani energy drinks but the flavor packet it a lot more tart and way stronger than the cans. Mixed easily win my waters and the price was pretty good especially compared to buying an individual 10 drinks. Tastes good but there's a noticeable difference. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been a fan of Alani Nu's Juicy Peach energy drink in the cans, and I was excited to try the powder version. Overall, it’s a great product! The flavor is delicious — sweet, fruity, and refreshing, just like the canned version. It mixes well in water and doesn’t have that weird aftertaste some powders can leave. My only downside is that it doesn’t pack quite the same energy \"kick\" as the canned drink; it comes close, but I feel like it’s just a little bit milder. Still, it’s a solid option when I need a convenient, tasty pick-me-up. Definitely worth trying if you’re a fan of Alani Nu! Read more | 4.0\nPerks me up every morning just like the energy drinks, tastes very similar compared to other packet flavors I’ve tried. Loveeee this flavor and the pink slush if you can find that one anywhere it also tastes like the fizzy drink. But the cherry flavor is just right. Dunno how there’s no sugar it’s quite sweet Read more | 5.0\nReceived product okay BUT check or ask about date of expirations...as my order expires in ONE MONTH (received in Feb. 2025 EXPIRE in March 2025)  so some packets are already clumped at the end of the tube. And with 3 boxes in the order, I know I  will not be avle to use all of the product before it expires.  Also the taste is not the same. Not a happy camper. Read more | 3.0\nI recently tried the Alani Nu Hawaiian Shaved Ice Energy Drink, and it has quickly become a staple in my routine. Here’s why I’m so impressed with it: Flavor and Taste: The flavor of Hawaiian Shaved Ice is absolutely delightful. It captures the essence of a tropical paradise with its fruity and refreshing taste. Unlike many energy drinks that have a medicinal aftertaste, this one is smooth and enjoyable, making it a pleasure to drink. Energy Boost: The energy boost from Alani Nu is both effective and steady. With 200 mg of caffeine, it provides a significant energy lift without the jitters or crash that some other energy drinks cause. It’s perfect for getting through long workdays, intense workouts, or any time you need an extra push. Nutritional Profile: Alani Nu does a fantastic job of keeping their drinks low in sugar and calories while still delivering great taste. Each can has just 10 calories and is free of sugar, making it a guilt-free option. Additionally, it contains essential vitamins like B6 and B12, which support energy metabolism. Convenience: The sleek, vibrant packaging is not only eye-catching but also convenient to carry around. Whether you’re heading to the gym, office, or just need a pick-me-up during the day, it’s easy to toss a can in your bag and go. Overall: Alani Nu Hawaiian Shaved Ice Energy Drink is a top-tier choice for anyone looking for a delicious, effective, and health-conscious energy boost. The tropical flavor is a standout, and the drink’s ability to provide clean energy without a crash makes it a winner in my book. It’s a bit on the pricier side, but the quality and benefits justify the cost. Read more | 5.0\nMy daughter is a CNA and loves the taste and the energy these give her.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Tropical Taste Pack Remix Variety Pack Mango Splash Green Apple Fruity Flavors Bundle Dwanta's Holiday Punch Wild Orange White Peach Tropical Punch Strawberry Watermelon Pineapple Coconut Frosted Grape Cherry Limeade Super Berry Alright, let’s talk energy drinks. I’ve tried a bunch of them, and Zoa energy drinks are definitely up there with the best. They’re packed with good stuff like vitamins, electrolytes, and amino acids, and they give me a solid energy boost without making me feel jittery. Plus, the flavors are pretty awesome – I mean, who doesn’t love a good Tropical Punch or Pineapple Coconut? But here’s the thing – as much as I love Zoa for a midday pick-me-up, I still start my mornings with Yerba Magic. There’s just something about it that sets the tone for the day. Yerba Magic is this fantastic instant yerba mate drink that’s super easy to make. Just mix a scoop with water, and you’re good to go. No steeping, no fuss – perfect for my groggy, half-asleep self in the morning. Yerba Magic has this refreshing peach mango flavor that’s a nice wake-up call. It’s packed with prebiotics and probiotics, so my gut feels great, and the energy boost is smooth and steady. I don’t get those annoying jitters or crashes, which is a huge win. It’s like all the benefits of traditional yerba mate without the hassle of brewing it. I usually get mine in less than two days when I order it off Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5YVMX9Q Yerba Magic is loaded with prebiotics and probiotics, which are key players in maintaining a healthy digestive system. The prebiotics, like chicory inulin and apple fiber, help nourish the good bacteria in your gut, making them more effective. This, in turn, supports better digestion and overall gut health. Since I started drinking Yerba Magic, I’ve noticed a significant reduction in bloating and digestive discomfort. So, my routine goes like this: I kick off the day with Yerba Magic to get my head straight and my energy flowing. Then, if I need an extra boost later in the day, I grab a Zoa. It’s the perfect combo – Yerba Magic keeps me focused and balanced in the morning, and Zoa gives me that extra push when I need it, especially during those afternoon slumps. In short, Zoa energy drinks are fantastic, but Yerba Magic is my go-to for starting the day right. If you’re looking for a great way to boost your mornings and stay energized throughout the day, give this combo a try. You won’t be disappointed! Read more | 5.0\nNew favorite energy drink! All of the flavors were good, although, not a huge fan of the watermelon. Has about 160mg of caffeine vs other drinks with 200. Caffeine comes from green tea and green coffee beans. Has multiple vitamins and electrolytes. I wish I could find them in bulk at stores! Read more | 5.0\nI was a hardcore Celcius fan and prior to that a Red Bull fan. But wanted to give ZOA a try. I first tried the Tropical Punch flavor and right away, love it! It doesn't have the weird \"fake sugar\" taste that usually gives me a headache. It's crisp and honestly tastes like a light, fresh, less sweet Hawaiian Punch with a little fizz. And NO JITTERS! It's a clean, smooth energy that doesn't feel unnatural. I love that it comes in a 16-ounce option. My only complaint is the price because it can be pricey at times but it does seem to fluctuate. Cherry flavor is good as well.

But, it's great just the same! I live the variety, the not overbearing sweetness. I like to share new products with my co workers which is what I did when these arrived. I do believe we will all be ordering these in the future. Green 🍏 apple is good. Pineapple Coconut 🍍🥥is good. Not a huge fan of anything peach flavored. But the white peach 🍑is good too. Next on the list is Orange 🍊 , and I am looking forward to that! Read more | 5.0\nNot much on sports drinks but I do like the Zoe flavor original taste with low calories and green tea pick me up.

This product I definitely would like to continue to purchase. Read more | 5.0\nGreat flavor, it doesn’t take like it’s sugar free! I’m very happy I could find the 16oz cans again!

Read more | 5.0\nI’m 96 years old and I drink 5 of these a day (sarcasm). 1 before shift. There is some aftertaste due to the artificial sweetener, but otherwise, it is great cold. Bang is going thru some legal stuff so most of their stuff is unavailable, and other competitors like Rockstar, Redbull, and wimpy Reign 240 mg of caffeine doesn’t do it for me. Definitely worth the money at 23-25. I may go back to the vitamin store and go back to Bang to save $5, though. If you’re a caffeine-head like me, definitely recommend. yeet…!

    "reviews": "Variety Combo Watermelon Prickly Pear Pink Lemonade Pina Colada Peach Mango Orange Soda Orange Cream Limon Lemon Iced Tea Grapefruit Grape Citrus Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Black Cherry Berry Fruit Punch I didn't know what to expect but i was pleasantly surprised at how amazing these are! First, the flavors: 10/10 I got the variety pack to try out different flavors. My favorites are raspberry and black cherry so far. They are so tasty with no sugar free aftertaste whatsoever. Next, the fizz: 9/10 The fizz is very mild, not overbearing. Not as fizzy as a seltzer, just a fine, enjoyable texture on the tongue. Lastly, the energy: 10/10!! Ok, I'm an RN and this is the important part for me. Most energy drinks are too caffeinated and make me feel like jittery garbage then a crash comes later. This is honestly the best kind of energy drink I've ever tried because it gave me a rush of bright, jitter-less energy that lasted from 7a to 3pm, then i had a second one and it had the same effect, getting me through the rest of the shift. No crash, no headache, just a taper off of energy until i rebooted with the second one. I love this product and I'll be subscribing monthly so I never run out. So so good!!! Read more | 5.0\nZipfizz Pink Lemonade is my go-to energy drink! The flavor is light, refreshing, and not overly sweet, with the perfect balance of tart and smooth lemonade taste.

Always was a pain in the butt trying to score a good deal on them though until Amazon finally started to ship them in these 15 pack boxes. Only certain gas stations would carry them and sometimes I would spot then at Dollar General stores. Walmart rarely had them in stock in my area and most other stores only carried Red Bull, Monster or their own store brand. When I saw Amazon got them, I subscribed right away.

Yellow 5 dye for color Cyanocobalamin for B12 instead of Methylcobalamin One thing I did notice is that Amazon has been slowly upping the price of these, probably due to their popularity. Back in Oct 2024, they were $22.50 per 15 pack before S&S discount, latest order in January 2025 was $26.30 before S&S. Still worth it for now, not enough to drop a star at this point.

    "reviews": "Pomegranate Peach Apple Variety Pack A little pricey for tea I'm used to getting for 99 cents, but this isn't your average Arizona tea! It's a carbonated energy drink with a sweet and tart flavor! Pomegranate has a cranberry-like bitterness to it, so if you enjoy cranberry juice you'll like the tartness of the pomegranate flavor. Apple tastes a little artificial, like a jolly rancher. It's far less sour than pomegranate, but it's got a better balance between sweet and tart. Peach is my favorite by far! Ice cold, it tastes like a peach soda! And the tea flavor is a little more noticeable here too! Mind you, I drank all ice cold! And the box is super cool too! Read more | 5.0\nThe tast was good. All the flavors were good .  Energy level was good ,no jitters .They are too expensive to order now, they have doubled the price to $65 that's ridiculous. Read more | 5.0\nI was really afraid it would taste bad like sugar free energy drinks but it turned out to be so delicious that I would drink it all in a day, BUT. There is a lot of caffeine inside, which is good for a full time worker 6 days a week. Double dose of coffee (each 24 oz) doesn’t work for me anymore. This tea made me feel so woken and energized, I couldn’t believe it’s happening. But at 3 am I was still awake… drink it before noon and you will be good. The box it was shipped in is made from a very thick carton, each can is separated from another and secured properly. Cans designed amazing. Read more | 5.0\nIf you collect cool drinks/cans or you’re a fan of the Fallout video games/tv series consider getting this.  The product design is pretty cool.  However, the flavors were just ok.  I definitely think if you’re craving Arizona teas the OG flavors are still the best. Read more | 4.0\nA long time lover of Arizona tea, and I was interested in how energy drinks from them might taste, so I gave this a shot. All the flavors are good - the red apple is very much a candy apple flavor/artificial apple rather than leaning towards a natural or cider like flavor. The pomegranate is a bit more up my alley; it's sweet of course but it also has a layer of sourness to it like a real pomegranate would. If you're not a fan of the fruit you probably won't like the drink, but it's one of my favorite fruits so I really enjoyed it. The peach flavor is super similar to regular Arizona peach tea, but with more peach syrup. The cans are a good size, you'll be peeing a lot if you drink a full one in a single sitting. On the carbonation front, they're not super carbonated. Only lightly, so don't be expecting the level of carbonation you'd get in a soda or anything like that. Made the mistake of shaking a can out of habit but it didn't even explode or fizz out of the can when I opened it. Overall: delicious and worth purchasing at least the once! Read more | 5.0\nAs a fan of fallout, and enjoyer of Arizona Tea, when I saw this, I was very excited to try. The package came in excellent condition with no damage to the cans or anything. They also stayed carbonated, so we're not flat when drank. Honestly, I don't really gain much benefit from energy drinks in general, so I can't speak too much towards whether it provides any effects there. I got this more for the novelty and to try the different flavors. The Pomegranate is my personal favorite! If you're also a fan of Fallout and Arizona, I definitely recommend giving this a try! Read more | 5.0\nI like the pomegranate flavor ok, but the other two are mediocre. The apple especially disappointing because it's such an easy flavor. The can is pretty, but slick.

Read more | 5.0\nPlease stop packaging them this way!! I adore this flavor and drink. It is my morning “coffee.” I’ve had two whole orders (2 twelve packs in each order) have to be cancelled and returned because they busted in transit. Now, I have an order with a bunch of the cans deformed from smashing around… aka they were 🤏🏻this close to busting also. All of this has just been since they’ve been sent together in a huge box in their new shrink wrapped packaging. The box they’re being shipped in is too big, so they jostle around and smash together. But what I really don’t get is why Mountain Dew changed the packaging??? The cardboard boxes that had each drink in its own cardboard compartment were perfect. Kickstarts have always been known to bust, so the better protection made sense and worked. I get it costs more, so charge a little more or something! I literally buy this flavor in bulk on Amazon because it’s hard to find, and it’s by far my favorite. If I have any of the red flavors for more than a couple days in a row, the red dye gives me migraines. And this flavor has (if I’m not mistaken) the most actual juice content of the flavors. It’s absolutely my go to. Every. Day. It’s not too much caffeine, and it makes me feel GOOD! My entire family swears by “Yellows” as we call them. 😂 We’ve been known to walk in a Dollar General and holler out, “They have Yellows! Get a buggy!” To which the cashier said, “Oh! I wondered what you were talking about,” as they checked out our 20 Pineapple Orange Mango Kickstarts one by one. 🙈😅 I would love to change my review to 5 stars… if you fix the packaging issues. 🙏🏻 Read more | 4.0\nReally tasty jolt that is not always easy to find.  Buy a case for the overachiever in your life. Read more | 5.0\nThey changed their recipe and these things became absolute garbage... undrinkable even. Some can taste like chemicals and literally burn your mouth, others like the smell of rotten pineapple... just grotesque. Used to be the only soda I was drinking. Eh. Read more | 5.0\nI have ordered the Pineapple Orange Mango flavor 37 times over maybe 3 years. I love this stuff. It has only 90 mg of caffeine in 16 oz and much less sugar than non-diet sodas. They're cheaper than sodas, too. At the current price, each can is between $1.50 and $2. That's also cheaper than coffee at many coffee shops and convenience stores. I don't get tired of them. The cans are often delivered well. I've had one instance of significant bending to the can rim this entire time, but the integrity of the contents was maintained. I'll definitely keep buying.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Tropical Uprising Revel Berry Lemon Elation Enlighten Mint Bravo Mango Bluephoria Berry Lemonade Awakening Orange Peach Revival As a long-time yerba mate fan, I’ve always loved Guayakí for its bold flavors, convenience, and reliable energy boost. But recently, I discovered Wisdom Tea—a sweet tea instant yerba mate that feels like a healthy, flavorful game-changer. Now, I alternate between the two, creating the ultimate balance of energy and health. Guayakí is perfect for grab-and-go moments, though the sugar content and occasional energy crash can be a downside. Wisdom Tea, on the other hand, is low-sugar, packed with probiotics, and delivers steady, focused energy thanks to its blend of yerba mate, L-theanine, and adaptogens. Together, they’re the dream team—Guayakí for bold, fast energy, and Wisdom Tea for smooth, health-focused stamina. If you’re a yerba mate enthusiast, this duo might just redefine your routine. Read more | 5.0\nMy partner loves these! They taste great, they have better ingredients for your body, sugar content isn’t too bad, your energy level feels great and more refreshed (not jittery and all over the place). For the price of these drinks and the ingredients they use, I would say that price is fair. Read more | 5.0\nI buy this exact flavor and unit from the same seller all the time. Perfect for a grab and go caffeine for work. No crash or jittery feeling. I'm a big repeat customer. These are simple, taste great, and arrive quickly. They're on time, everytime. Now I have to buy them more often because my partner loves them too! Read more | 5.0\nI first tried this brand and flavor this last Sunday and I love the taste. I thought at first it was kombucha and I was not a fan. However, I tried it and it was very good. I think if I wasn't so tired or had lack of sleep that I would've felt that difference in my energy. I have been drinking Celsius and I haven't quite felt the difference with that drink at all. So we shall see if this one works. Read more | 5.0\nThis product is delicious and refreshing!! Has caffeine so be cautious!! Read more | 5.0\nI love the flavor and it helps me focus on my day! Read more | 5.0\nReally tasty, and I really like the smooth caffeination that it provides. Slightly more expensive, but the clean and low ingredient number is something that few other \"energy drinks\". There's no artificial sweeteners, which is good because otherwise I wouldn't buy it at all. But they really have too much sugar.  Way too much sugar. They could drop the sugar by 1/2 and it would still be good. In fact, I'd pay more for a 1/2 sugar variant so I can get my caffeine, but not be stuffed with sugar. Read more | 4.0\nUPDATE: As of 02/17/2025 I'd received a very pleasant response to my review from the seller. After explaining my situation, we'd reached a more than fair accord. During the interim, I'd placed faith in ordering another 12 pack, which cake in both timely and undamaged, which reinforced my thought that maybe this was just a one time incident. Thank you for both the understanding and the help with resolving the issue professionally; I'll gladly be a repeat customer of this seller. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm a first time purchaser of these here in Amazon. Price was good and fair, product seemed good. The only reason for the 3 stars is that some of the cans arrived damaged and leaked over the rest of the case and box. I don't typically have to contact a seller but if someone could reach out to me, I'd appreciate it and I'd gladly amend my review. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "Great taste and good variety of recovery vitamins and BCAAs Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is a little vitamin like, but I prefer them to synthetic caffeine and artificial sweeteners. I feel great afterwards instead of dreading the crash. Read more | 5.0\nI bought a couple cans at my local grocery store on a whim.  Recovery and focus to be exact.  I fell in love with them, so I got this variety pack becasue there were flavors/mixes I couldn't get locally and I wanted to try them all.  They are all good.  No weird buzzes or other adverse reactions and ACTUAL RESULTS.  I can not stress that enough.  THEY WORK.  I used travel aid last week right before we left on our trip by plane.  This may be TMI but I was also a day away from my period and as many women know, that's when we get sick the most easily.  Our bodies defenses are low then and adding a trip on a plane to that mix with all that entails means I usually get some kind of illness when the timing lands like that.  I felt fine.  Had some partyaid when we got to our destination becasue I lost so much sleep due to flight cancellations.  Not only did I not get sick, I felt pretty good too.  I was alert, able to focus, able to sleep and felt much healthier than I would have had I not had these to help pick up the travel slack. My favorites are recoveryaid for post gym or lost sleep, focusaid for when I write or need to be on top mentally, and travelaid for immune boosts.  If I didn't drink a cup of coffee before the gym every morning, I would use golferaid.  It gives energy, but a bit too much for anything that isn't physical.  Partyaid is also good but not something I see myself needing all that often as I don't really drink and I usually sleep fine.  Lifeaid is also fine, but I think I'll drink enough of the others to not need it as much in general. They all taste good, though are best cold, I won't lie.  The lack of heaps of sugar is fantastic and I can not recommend these drinks enough.  In a world were we are all a little deficient in nutrients, these drinks are a life saver.  They give just a little extra boost when you need it most.  I look forward to years of using these.  Just a fantastic product. Read more | 5.0\nDrinks taste amazing and I absolutely love this brand. The only reason I am doing 4 stars is because I was suppose to get the drinks with 40mg of caffeine and I got caffeine free ones. Read more | 4.0\njust to qualify my review, I do not drink soft drinks, other than a cold brew drink in the morning consume zero caffeine, and zero alcohol …pretty much I drink water and decaf ice tea.  The big problem with this sort of lifestyle is that it causes me at least to yearn for some other alternative.  Several years ago, I had found the ideal drink - BrainToniq; unfortunately, that was discontinued.  what came next was several years of trying a variety of “unique” drinks . I tried sugary and sugar free, fizzy and flat, caffeinated and not, and expensive and cheap.  I have to say that those of us who do not drink love in a golden age of Non-Alcoholic beverages.  A trip to a high need grocery, can provide a host of new candidates. After 20+ years of shopping on Amazon, my affinity for the store as well as my proclivity to find what I need and want here, no longer comes as a surprise.  I heard about focusaid from a friend online who loved it.  I searched for distributors and found Amazon, even better Amazon offers it on subscribe & save which makes it even easier.  When the shipment arrived, I immediately tried a sip at room temperature, and then over ice, and I also put a couple in the refrigerator.  my favorite way to enjoy these is definitely chilled with no ice.  My favorite time to enjoy one is the late afternoon. Another caveat about me, I have suffered with ADHD my whole life.  it has never been treated because my parents were opposed.  at some point I came to terms with it and see it has being both a blessing and a curse.  I say all that because focus is an often fast fleeting feeling with me.  So in regards to focusaid bring focus, I am not sure I am qualified to answer.  What I will say is at the end of a day, this beverage does sharpen the mind.  Probably won’t allow you to pass an academic test you haven’t prepared for, but I find the drink to be refreshing as well as calming.  The big thing for me is it has a complex favor that tastes nothing like water or ice tea. I should also mention that this is not an over caffeinated energy drink.  It has a very adult taste to it - I doubt most children and teens would care for it which may also feel like a plus if you often feel like your kids eat everything.  I have heard this compared to Fresca, in some ways I agree, but I don’t like Fresca and love this.  I am glad that drinks like these are available and I hope you will too.

The drink is smooth and the flavor is a classic one.  It don't have a bad aftertaste either. I love that it comes in a 20oz can. Most drinks aren't that big.  By being so big, i can set it down  in the fridge and come back to it and be able to have a nice drink to sip on all day!  The can itself is appealing and discreet.  I looooove that it comes sugar free!  Some of the other energy drinks have a poor flavor  or aftertaste in their sugar free options.  Red Bull Sugar Free Energy Drink with 189mg Caffeine plus Taurine & B Vitamins tastes just as good as the full flavor drinks in my opinion. After pricing the energy drinks out there that don't have any sugar, I was happy to see that these were a better deal than most other sugar free energy drink options!

Around that mid-afternoon slump, when my focus starts to disappear, cracking open one of these gives me just the right boost to power through the rest of the day. The 80mg of caffeine hits the sweet spot—not too much, not too little—and I like that it’s sugar-free, so I don’t crash later. I’ve tried other sugar-free energy drinks, but they either taste weirdly artificial or leave me jittery. This one just works. It’s crisp, refreshing, and predictable in the best way. Plus, I’ll admit, there’s something oddly satisfying about that pssst when you open the can. It’s definitely become part of my routine. My coworkers even joke that they know it’s 2:30 when they hear that familiar sound from my desk. If you need a reliable energy boost without the sugar overload, this one’s hard to beat.

    "reviews": "Watermelon Ice Strawberry Coconut Peach Vibe Kiwi Guava Lime Tropical Vibe Strawberry Mango Orange Cranberry Lemon Blueberry Lemonade Berry Dragonfruit Lime The CELSIUS On-the-Go Powder Stick Packs in Berry flavor (Zero Sugar, 14 Sticks per Pack, 2.5 Ounce per Pack) have received a lot of positive attention for their convenience, refreshing taste, and effective energy-boosting properties. Here’s a breakdown of what customers typically highlight in their reviews: ### **Taste:** Many users enjoy the **Berry flavor** of these powder sticks. It's described as **refreshing** and not overly sweet, despite being sugar-free. It strikes a balance between tart and sweet, providing a pleasant experience when mixed with water. ### **Convenience:** The **on-the-go powder sticks** are frequently praised for their portability. They come in individual packets, making them incredibly convenient for people who are always on the move. Simply add one packet to water and enjoy a quick energy boost without needing to carry bulky cans or bottles. ### **Performance:** CELSIUS powder sticks are marketed as a product that provides **natural energy** without the sugar crash associated with many energy drinks. The formula includes ingredients like **green tea extract, caffeine, and ginger**, which provide a clean boost of energy. Reviewers often mention feeling energized and alert after drinking, with many appreciating the **lack of jitters** or crashes. ### **Zero Sugar:** For those who are watching their sugar intake, the zero-sugar aspect is a significant selling point. Customers often note that they can enjoy a flavorful energy drink without the negative effects of sugar, like an insulin spike or crash. ### **Health Focus:** CELSIUS is positioned as a **fitness and wellness product**, so it's marketed as being free from artificial preservatives, flavors, and sweeteners. Many reviews highlight the product’s **health-conscious ingredients**, which include **vitamins and minerals** that may support metabolism. ### **Drawbacks:** Some customers mention that the flavor can be a bit **strong or artificial** for certain tastes, especially if mixed with too little water. Also, while the caffeine boost works for many, those sensitive to caffeine might find it a bit too strong. ### **Packaging:** The compact, lightweight packaging makes it perfect for tossing in a gym bag or backpack. The 14-stick pack provides a decent quantity for frequent use, though some users might find it runs out quickly if consumed regularly. Overall, **CELSIUS On-the-Go Powder Stick Packs** are highly rated for their **convenience**, **taste**, and **energy-boosting effects**. They're an excellent option for individuals looking for a sugar-free, healthy alternative to traditional energy drinks. If you enjoy berry-flavored drinks and need a quick pick-me-up, this product is likely a good fit. Just be mindful of the caffeine content if you're sensitive to stimulants. Read more | 5.0\nWhen I went to write this, I didn't think I would say much, but I guess there are a lot of benefits you don't really think about.  I'll really only be comparing the canned Celsius to the powder. At the current time, it's roughly $0.80 per serving vs $1.33/can serving (a Costco case) and up to probably $3 or more at a convenience store. So, it is absolutely delicious. I was kind of surprised the first time I tasted it. With any product's powder packets you can add to water, you can make it as dense or as watered-down as you like (customizable). I put 1 packet in my 40-ounce water bottle because I like a refreshing feeling/taste. In 40 ounces of water, my tastebuds say it's deliciously flavored water, not soda/juice. However, I could see people that hate that taste, and they would just put it in a standard sized plastic bottle to get the ultra-sweet, or non-water feel to it. There are a couple of additional benefits the way I drink it, in my opinion, that tie into each other. Because there is more water, naturally, I am getting more water intake, and it takes me longer to drink. Therefore, instead of getting 200 mg of caffeine at once and crashing, it is spread out over a much longer time period. I feel as though it's a much more sustained energy. And I used to drink 2 cans a day, but now I usually only have 1 (on my non-workout days) because it does what I need it to over a longer period of time. On my workout days, I will still generally have 1 for my workout and 1 for the day which is the same as what I do with the canned versions but the Celsius for the day lasts longer with the powder. I can't really do any of this with the carbonated cans because, for some reason, I just chug them. Additionally, since I am drinking more water, I feel like I eat less. I know caffeine is an appetite suppressant itself, but I am usually pretty content most of the day because I am full of water.  Again, this is in comparison to the cans and I don't seem to get as hungry. I do get hungry, just not \"hangry.\" It's not a miracle drug or anything. Another benefit I just thought about is that it stays colder for longer since it's in my insulated water bottles. I live in Phoenix, so if I am outside in the middle of summer, this is kind of a big deal. The only 2 downsides so far. 1. It seems to be that I go to the bathroom (#1, not #2) as much as I breathe. Okay, that's a little exaggerated, but it's a lot. However, I don't ever have to worry about having to pee in case I get popped for a drug test at work. lol 2. Also, I now carry 2 large water bottles around because I'll carry 1 bottle for Celsius and 1 for water. This leads to having to wash them both at the end of the day (put them in the dishwasher). Again, both of these \"cons\" don't pale in comparison to the pros. I now have almost 2 cases of canned Celsius laying around because I swapped to the powder packets immediately. I will drink the cans to get rid of them but will likely never buy (the cans) again. UPDATE: The use of these just keeps getting better. I am travelling out of country for a month, and I don't believe the country I am going to is big on energy drinks. BUT, I can take a month's worth of Celsius with me (only adding a miniscule amount of weight and space in luggage) and not carry 3 cases of cans, which I would never do anyway. Another reviewer had mentioned this already, but I was so happy I didn't have to worry about my Celsius addiction in another country and wanted to let you guys know that they are ultra-portable. Read more | 5.0\n\"I'm so impressed with Celcius in Powder! I purchased it to help combat fatigue, and it's been a total game-changer. This stuff really works! The powder is easy to mix and tastes great. I've been adding it to my water throughout the day, and I can feel a noticeable boost of energy. What I love most about Celcius is that it's not just a temporary energy fix. It actually helps to sustain my energy levels throughout the day, so I don't experience those pesky afternoon slumps. Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with Celcius in Powder. It's become a staple in my daily routine, and I couldn't recommend it more to anyone struggling with fatigue. Five stars, hands down!\" Read more | 5.0\nI bought these because im already a fan of the Celsius brand, and wanted to try the strawberry coconut flavor. I dont normally do powdered energy, but I couldnt find this flavor in can form. The flavor of these is better than average, it has a strong strawberry taste for sure, the coconut is a bit milder. Also love the convenience of these little pouches, you can tuck them in a pocket or purse for emergencies. Never know when you might need a boost of energy. I also like energy shots for this reason. Ideally I like a big can of energy drink poured into a foam cup with ice. Then i just sip thru a straw throughout the day and have a steady flow of energy. But these are worth getting, to stash everywhere for emergencies. And the price is very reasonable. Overall I highly recommend these!

It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters.

This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it!

The packaging ensures convenience and portability, making it easy to store and grab a can whenever needed, whether at home, work, or on the go. Taste and Flavor Profile: One of the standout features of Monster Energy Zero Ultra is its refreshing taste and appealing flavor profile. As a sugar-free energy drink enthusiast, I appreciate the balanced blend of citrus flavors with a hint of sweetness, which is both invigorating and enjoyable to drink. Unlike other energy drinks that can be overly sweet or artificial in taste, Monster Energy Zero Ultra offers a clean and crisp flavor that doesn't leave a lingering aftertaste. It's refreshing and satisfying, providing an instant pick-me-up without the guilt of added sugars.

Whether powering through deadlines at work or staying energized during workouts, Monster Energy Zero Ultra consistently delivers reliable performance and stamina support. Affordability and Value for Money: Purchasing Monster Energy Zero Ultra in a bulk pack of 15 cans offers significant cost savings compared to buying individual cans or smaller packs. The value for money is exceptional, especially considering the quality and effectiveness of the product.

Convenience and Versatility: The convenience of having a supply of Monster Energy Zero Ultra readily available cannot be overstated.

Read more | 5.0\nI have been ordering Monster off Amazon for a couple of years now. Amazon is by far the best price and the only place I can purchase a 15 pack of Monster. I have gotten Monster for under 2.00 a can by purchasing the sugar free flavors that are under $30. All of the flavors are decent, I’d have to say I lean more towards the berry flavors with Strawberry dreams being my favorite. But all Monster’s  have a crisp refreshing taste to them. The biggest and only problem I run into with purchasing Monster through Amazon is, the package have been damaged in the past. Very few cans have been dented. I have only had 3 cans ever be delivered that were not full and that was not Amazons fault it was a manufacturing error. These can’s were not dented, no holes were in these can’s, the top’s had not be opened at all. They were simply not filled correctly through the Monster warehouse. I never contacted Amazon about the 3 particular damaged cans or any of the damaged boxes. I did try to reach out to Monster and it was far too complicated to do so. They only allow you to contact them via their page that has particular options on how, what and where you purchased your Monster product.  purchasing a 15 pack of Monster through Amazon are not options. I also struggled with seeing  some of the information Monster requires off the can that is damaged. All in all I would recommend to anyone who drinks Monster on a regular basis for their daily boost of energy to purchase through Amazon. Read more | 5.0\nI purchased the Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango Sugar Free for my son, who needs a boost of energy but can't have the sugar. This drink is exactly what we were looking for! The flavor is delicious and refreshing, with a nice tropical mango taste that isn't too overpowering. It's sweetened just enough to make it enjoyable, but without any of the sugar that would normally be a concern. The energy boost is noticeable, and it helps my son stay focused and alert without any jitters or crashes, which can sometimes happen with other energy drinks. Plus, it's a great option for anyone looking to avoid sugar but still need that pick-me-up. Overall, I highly recommend Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango for anyone who needs an energy boost but wants to keep things sugar-free. It’s a win-win! Read more | 5.0\nI have tried EVERY flavor of Monster Zero Ultra and overall, love this product, love the taste, and love that it's sugar-free and only 10 calories THAT BEING SAID, not every flavor is created equal. The BEST flavors of Monster Ultra are... -Paradise (green can, tastes like green Jolly Ranchers) -Sunrise (orange, tastes like Sunny D but carboated) -Watermelon -Peachy Keen (this one is so friggin good, it's crazy how good it is) The WORST flavors are... -Fiesta Mango! Stay away from this one! It tastes so bad, it tastes like how a hair salon smells when someone gets their hair permed! -Red (It's just not very good, just has a very vague flavor). -Black (Also just not very good, tastes like cough medicine) But for real though, do NOT get the Fiesta Mango. It...is...so...bad! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\nIl gusto migliore preferito,ottimo | 5.0\nVon Monster Energy eins meiner liebsten Sorten, sehr angenehmer Wassermelonengeschmack! | 5.0\n1.0",

The flavor is like a fruity, sparkling party in a can—perfectly sweet with no sugar and no weird aftertaste. It’s hard to describe the flavor exactly, but it feels like a mix of berry and grape with a fun, cosmic twist. What’s even better is that it gives me the energy I need without the crash. I drink it in the afternoon for a pick-me-up, and it keeps me going through work or a workout. The fact that it’s sugar-free makes it guilt-free too! The packaging is super cute and eye-catching, and the carbonation level is just right—not too fizzy, not flat. I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious and refreshing energy drink. This one is my absolute favorite flavor from Alani Nu, and I can’t wait to keep stocking up! Read more | 5.0\nI recently started using Alani Nutrition products, and I am so impressed! The Alani Energy Drinks are my new go-to for a quick pick-me-up. They taste amazing (I’m obsessed with the Watermelon flavor!), and they give me a clean, sustained energy boost without any jitters or crashes. I’ve also tried the Alani Pre-Workout, and it delivers on all fronts—great taste, increased energy, and enhanced focus during my workouts. I love how it’s packed with ingredients that actually make a difference in my performance, plus it doesn’t upset my stomach like some other pre-workouts do. What I really appreciate is how Alani uses high-quality, transparent ingredients with no artificial junk. Plus, their products are all about supporting a healthy lifestyle, which resonates with me.

Whether you need a pre-workout boost, a mid-day pick-me-up, or just something to help you power through your day, this drink is a solid choice. Great taste, clean ingredients, and reliable energy. I'd buy it again! Read more | 5.0\nTo preface this review, I would consider myself an \"experienced\" consumer of energy drinks (I typically drink 4-5 per week, for the last few years). I have tried dozens of brands and hundreds of flavors at this point, given the frequency with which companies churn out new flavors. Overall, I've probably had an energy drink well over 1,000 times. I'll break this review into three parts: taste, effects, and (surprisingly) design. Taste: The first thing I noticed with all of the Omni flavors is that the literal flavor is not listed. Instead, there is a \"theme\" of sorts listed. The beach scene is called Beach Day, the racing design is Corsa, and the guy surfing on a wave is called Stoked. It seems like Omni is \"setting the stage\", with the flavor supposed to complement the design of the can. I had not seen this before and was somewhat intrigued and skeptical about the concept, but I have to say it works VERY well for me. Stoked tastes more laid-back and mellow than any other flavor, definitely reminiscent of those \"clear\" zero sugar sodas I have tried before. I really liked this one, and I think it absolutely matches the vibe. Corsa tasted almost \"electric\" and definitely had a tart, here-I-am explosion of flavor without being overly sweet, which I've come to appreciate after drinking so many of these. To me, both the flavor and the design are exciting, so I find myself really liking this concept. Beach Day was super bright, refreshing, and probably in between the other two in terms of flavor intensity. I could see myself drinking this one on a daily basis (and yes, I think the flavor represents the design extremely well yet again). Overall, I was a huge fan of the flavors on these, and I like the idea of leaving it up to us to interpret what a \"Beach Day\" tastes like. It's more fun that way and doesn't set me up for misinterpretation of a particular flavor. Personally, Beach Day was my favorite for daily drinking, but I would probably still pick up a variety pack because the other flavors are really good too. Effects: The effects of the Omni drinks were also a big plus for me. I appreciated the fact that they provide 100% of the daily recommended amount of some vitamins in the drink. I like knowing that I am getting at least some nutritional benefit from my energy drinks, even if it's something I may not \"feel\" immediately, like B vitamins or Vitamin C. They also list their Omni Energy active ingredients on the side, which I thought was smart for transparency. I like knowing exactly how much of each ingredient is going into my body, especially if they aim to alter my state (nootropics, stimulants, etc). I thought the way Omni made me feel was great, definitely more focused on mood than ones I've tried in the past. The 200mg of caffeine is a solid amount for me, and I felt lighter throughout the day, which was a unique experience. Looking up what some of these ingredients do, and based on my own experience trying other energy drinks, I think they did a really good job of creating something that gives you energy (since that's kind of the point), but also uplifts your mood to a noticeable degree, without being overbearing or overwhelming at all. Design: The reason I say \"surprisingly\" in the beginning of my review is that I would never normally take the time to think more than a couple of seconds about the design of an energy drink. To me, I care more about the taste and if it gives me energy. That being said, the designs on these Omni cans are really impressive and tie into their flavoring concept. I have never seen an energy drink that puts so much emphasis on making me \"feel\" something when I hold their can. But they do, and that's something I never knew I even wanted from my energy drinks. All of the designs are phenomenal, and you can tell they took their time matching the art and the flavors. There are also cool details on the cans, and you can actually FEEL the waves and the sand. It makes me want to keep it around because the cans look so good juxtaposed against my gray workspace lol. So while I normally would not review the design of an energy drink can, Omni knocked it out of the park on all three aspects. Probably because I also like the taste the most for daily drinking, I would say Beach Day is my favorite design overall as well. I can't exactly get over to the beach during a work week, so it's kind of fun to have something aesthetically pleasing with me. Overall, this is a win for me. Flavors, effects, and design are all great in my eyes. I will definitely make this a regular pick-up Read more | 5.0\nOmni has beaten the competition hands down!  The flavors are crisp and very refreshing! I have let my coworkers try a sample of each and they have ordered their own Omni as well. Do yourself a favor and try them all! I normally would never try anything peach flavored( I also don’t eat peaches) but the Georgia has quickly become my favorite out of the ones I’ve tried so far and I personally rank them as ( Georgia,Pineapple MK2, Beach Day, and Island Gold) They are all amazing and I will still order them all as it is nice being able to keep the palate fresh. Having been a 3 monster a day drinker, I can confidently say one to two Omnis get me thru the day and I no longer yawn and feel tired most of the day. The energy is calm, focused, and doesn’t leave you with jitters, or the crash of other energy drinks.

The ingredients are clean, which is a huge plus for me, and the taste is fantastic—no weird aftertaste like some other energy drinks.

    "reviews": "Watermelon Strawberry Peach Hardcore Apple Berry Sangria Fruit Punch Always great, its really the only flavor I prefer. Love Rockstar! Tastes great, great quality. Always helps me get going in the morning with the caffeine. Priced well below the stores. Read more | 5.0\nI have been drinking Rockstar Punched energy for years. It has always been my favorite energy drink to make it through those extra-long shifts at work or power through tough workouts. The flavor is bold, and yeah, it definitely gives a strong energy kick if that's what I need. It had just about everything one could want: a bunch of caffeine and a load of sugar, too, which always really gave me that immediate kick. But as much as I've enjoyed rockstar over the years, recently I tried Aura caffeine pouches, and man, they're so much better. The first thing I noticed about Aura is how smooth and long-lasting the energy was. This was because, with Rockstar, I'd get a quick burst of energy, but that usually didn't last too long. Most times, by the end of the day, I crashed. However, Aura seems to give pretty steady energy, lasting for hours without making me jittery or wired. I think the nootropic blend makes a huge difference-ingredients such as Cognizin citicoline and theanine. I have a lot more energy, but also feel really focused and clear-headed, which wasn't the case with Rockstar. Of course, another big plus about Aura over Rockstar would be that it contains no sugar at all. Rockstar is a drink loaded with sugar, and although this may give me an immediate boost of energy, it could often make me feel a bit sluggish later on. Aura is sugar-free and made from clean, natural ingredients, so I don't have to be as concerned about crashing or feel guilty about what I'm taking. Plus, the sour gummy flavor is amazing, way more enjoyable than any Rockstar flavor I've tried. I grabbed mine here https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF35MFQP Aura is also a lot more convenient. With Rockstar, I always had to carry around a can and make sure to drink it before it got warm. But Aura pouches are small, easy to carry, and require no preparation whatsoever. I can pop a pouch in my mouth anytime I need an energy boost, at work, at the gym, or running errands; it's just so much more practical for my busy lifestyle. I still think Rockstar is not bad, but that's especially if you want just a quick shot of energy. However, Aura has become a much better choice for me: the energy is longer, cleaner, and it helps me stay focused without the side effects I used to get from drinking Rockstar. If you want more than your usual, ordinary energy drink, I strongly recommend trying the Aura pouches-you won't regret it! Read more | 5.0\nRockstar is the best energy drink. They have a variety of good flavors ( fruit punch is the best). 250 mg of caffeine is the perfect amount for me to sustain throughout the day. Highly recommend it. Read more | 5.0\nTastes good if you like apple. Sorta close to a green apply jolly rancher. It is very sweet so just keep that in mind if you don't prefer sweet drinks! Read more | 5.0\nI enjoyed this flavor...it is a bit clingy and doesn't pair well with meals, IMO...nice \"desert drink\" with a bit of a kick. Read more | 4.0\nI recently tried the Rockstar Punched Energy Drink in the Fruit Punch flavor, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in both taste and value. I purchased the 16oz cans in a convenient 12-pack, and it has quickly become my go-to energy boost. The Fruit Punch flavor is incredibly refreshing, striking the perfect balance between sweetness and a tangy kick. Unlike some other energy drinks, Rockstar Punched doesn't have an overpowering artificial taste – it's just the right amount of flavor to invigorate your senses. What sets this energy drink apart is not just its taste but also its affordability. The 12-pack is priced competitively, making it an excellent value for the quality you get. I appreciate that I can enjoy a delicious energy boost without breaking the bank. The 16oz cans are also a great size, providing enough energy to power through my day without the need for constant refills. Whether I'm tackling a workout or just need a pick-me-up during a busy afternoon, Rockstar Punched has become my reliable companion. In conclusion, if you're looking for an energy drink that delivers on taste, quality, and affordability, Rockstar Punched in the Fruit Punch flavor is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing and invigorating experience without compromising on their budget. Read more | 5.0\nI love, love, love this flavor. In my opinion it's the tastiest energy drink to be had. I mean, it's green apple and it tastes like it. What's not to like? Only better thing would be if Rockstar would make a pear flavor. 😉 Read more | 5.0\nIf you're hard core like this can chug this thing down in the morning, you'll be on a Sugar Rush from hell.

I'm older now and don't want to experience multiple organ failure so I figured, you know, browse Amazon for options. Since COVID, online shopping was my go-to. Came in a nice thin box holder with plastic wrap. Stuff tastes amazing! A little on the sweet side, so I am sure you can order this without sugar and it would still taste good. The amount of sugar it has is less than your average soda. I've ordered these a few times and so far each package is perfect. No dented or nasty bottles, no defects, etc... The body feel is great, too. Other energy drinks can make you feel wired and are extremely strong. 250mg of caffeine is just way too much. This sports 150 and is the perfect. So I don't get caffeine/sugar crashes off it. Also, doesn't leave me feeling dehydrated too much like your standard coffee would.

I find that concentrated flavorings (like Mio and Crystal Light) has a strong powdery taste if you use the recommended dilution. I strongly dislike it and don't use those because of it. However, all 3 flavors in this variety pack (Berryade, Strawberry Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade) have the that same powdery taste. Your mileage may obviously vary, but if you don't like the powdery taste of concentrated flavorings, I would not recommend this AT ALL. Read more | 1.0",

Read more | 5.0\nI love these Prime Energy Drinks. The issue is availability. I have ordered these in the past yeR and could easily get a case of 24 delivered overnight by 7 AM.

Prime and Celsius seem to be my favorite energy drinks that are widely available, and this Prime ice pop might have pushed it near the top for me. Good value and great flavor.

Read more | 5.0\nFirst time trying prime, and happy to say that they have an enjoyable flavor and are very easy to drink.  Not the best tasting energy drink I've every had, but certainly does not have any of the bad medicinal flavors that some drinks have. The boost I get from the drink is also not the biggest I've ever experienced from a drink, but its noticeable.  While I might look to something else before a workout or before heavy manual activity in the yard or the garage, Prime give me a pleasant boost of energy when I need it without jitters or unpleasant effects from too much stimulant.  I'd use these on a study day or before gaming. At the price point, I don't think you could go wrong with these, I think I'll be coming back! Read more | 4.0",

You would not buy a 12 oz beverage of this for the flavor, it is good enough to drink 2 oz to get the energy. It is a store brand and does not hit as hard as the name brand but it still works as intended. The packaging and presentation have always been less than ideal. Most bottles have a little fluid that spilled out around the cap and dried. The perforations on plastic safety wrap are too shallow to work and usually have to use a knife or scissors to open the bottles. They are on par for an off brand where you get what you pay for. They work relative to the price and are budget friendly. Read more | 3.0\nLove this product, it works great. I usually drink this about half way through my work shift and it gives me the energy i need to get through the rest of the day. I dont crash and no jitters but i do eat when i take it!

Otherwise the flavors/colors are similar to crystal light, with the lemonade being identical aside from the little bit of weird fizz. Not terrible, but also nothing to write home about. In terms of mixability and ease of use, getting it mixed/dissolved took a little more stirring than what I'd expect. Probably something with the weird fizz. Most of the time I mix it up in a cup in the break room at work, which is fine, but I mixed a couple bottles when I was out fishing and the fizz made it spray a little bit when I opened the cap. All that being said, the 40 pack of these are somewhere between $90 and $140 cheaper than buying cans on the way to work every day for 2 months so there is that.

It gives me a surge of energy to annihilate the gym. It also warms your body up pretty quick as well. Guys I have to say I use this as a pre-sex workout energy drink for all of the same reasons and benefits as the gym. Because that is one of the major reasons we go to the gym. Good health and to be appealing to women. And once you get the woman of choice peak performance is key (pun intended). Read more | 5.0\nI've used pre-workouts for years, but as I've gotten older, many of them either make my heart race to unusually high pulse or increase my blood pressure for hours after. This uncarbonated version of the C4 gives me great energy and increased strength, without increasing my BP or Pulse. Great stuff! Read more | 5.0\nI like having some type of boost before heading to the gym and C4 is one of the better for that.  The Orange Slice flavor is OK and you can often get it discounted.  The Fruit Punch is by far the best flavor I've tried but is usually the most expensive.  I like the energy that I get from the product and find it to be effective.  The yellow bottles/cans contain 200 mg of caffeine and large amounts of Vitamin B.  I have gone from drinking a full bottle to half a bottle before working out and that seems to do the job.  My only watch out is to be smart if you are caffeine sensitive because this will stay with you for a few hours.  Otherwise good product. Read more | 4.0\nLove it.

    "reviews": "Wild Berry Watermelon Mint Vanilla Grapefruit Blood Orange Blackberry I like this drink but would love to see more flavors. How about grape, strawberry and chocolate (everything else the same, only the flavor changes)? It’s nice to have a quick organic energy boost option available that has zero sugar of any kind. I wish these would be available even in my local grocery store. Thanks HiBall! Read more | 5.0\nAlthough a bit spendy, it's worth every penny, as  each can is a generous-sized 16 oz and the quality of ingredients is equally impressive.  This lovely vanilla energy seltzer has a clean, vanilla-infused flavor with no aftertaste.  For vanilla lovers, the strong flavor-infusion trumps any desire for sweetness - it's pure vanilla!  With 160mg organic caffeine, 50mg organic guarana, and 50mg organic ginseng, one can will give you energy that lasts for most of the day.  It's definitely a keeper! Read more | 5.0\nI remember getting this years ago and it tasted much better, had more carbonation, and the energy felt a lot more like a regular caffeinated beverage. I don't know what crap they're putting in this new version of Hi-ball energy but 6 or so hours after consuming this stuff I started to feel super flat, anxious, heart began to race, and I became dizzy. Felt similar to a panic attack or something. I can usually consume pretty sizeable amounts of caffeine but for some reason this drink now has made me feel like this 3 times in a row. I will never drink this stuff again because it is not \"clean energy\", it is CRAP energy. Read more | 1.0\nThe absolute best energy drink out there! We were SUPER bummed when the original was discontinued and I was hesitant to think that a new formulation could match then former. The new manufacturer has done a great job! Great taste and without the crash that comes from a lot of energy drinks. Read more | 5.0\nI love that this is just bubble water, a nice flavor essence and caffeine. No weird stuff, no disgusting tasting vitamins, no even more disgusting tasting fake sugar. Yes, stevia is fake sugar and tastes just as gross as the chemical ones. Read more | 5.0\nI used to buy these at Ralph's up until a year or so ago. Unfortunately Anheuser-Busch discontinued this brand several years after acquiring it from the original, \"grassroot\" creators. Now it's owned/operated by Tilray Brands, based in NY. My first observation is that it seems slightly less carbonated and less flavored than I recall. Keep in mind HiBall's appeal was its' clean, sugar-free, lightly flavored recipe, along with a medium-dose of caffiene, at 160mgs. (400 milligrams is the FDA cutoff. Anymore than 200 in one day might blow my adrenal system out and induce a cardiac event) But it just seems a little lighter in carbonation and flavor than I recall. Still good, though. Wild Berry was always my go-to. I'm not sure if Tilray is cutting corners on ingredients, or even the aluminum cans, but I will order some other flavors to test myself. In the meantime, I'm fairly happy to recommend if you're not in the mood for the many zombie-piss and depleted uranium-based caffeine drinks out there. Cheers. Read more | 4.0\nCan’t understand why they stopped selling in stores & gyms…  this was hands down the best energy drink ever. So refreshing, no gross “sweet” flavor like other “healthy sugar free” energy drinks, perfect level of carbonation unlike the “barely carbonated” drinks… really great product Read more | 5.0\nVery disappointed in the blackberry flavor. It tastes like sparkling tap water. Blackberry itself seems like it would do well, but the water is so stale that it is unpleasant. Read more | 2.0",

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Summer Variety Pack Strawberry Watermelon Pink Lemonade Peach Bellini Cherry Lime Blood Orange Berry Elixir I like this drink, it has a hood flavor and keeps me energized for hours as I work overnight. I was drinking Alani and would have to supplement with other caffenated drinks to stay awake. Amino lean gives me a good clean energy with no jitters which may be attributed to the green tea. I'll be ordering again soon. Read more | 5.0\nI really enjoyed the flavor, especially the aftertaste when it becomes subtle and even more delicious. The amount of carbonation is perfect, as I usually avoid carbonation beverages because of much carbonation is in them. Those two points are the biggest factors that I enjoyed. The packaging is also super cute and easy to bring with me anywhere I go as it is slim and easy to grab when I’m in a rush. It definitely kept my energy levels consistent throughout the day, without the overconsumption of caffeine. Overall, it’s a great product that makes my life so much easier, and a bit healthier. I use this product as a pre-workout, but more so as a coffee replacement and pick me up because I am a heavy coffee drinker and I always need something new to switch things up. It helps cut down my coffee consumption but still gives me the coffee-effect. Read more | 5.0\nI tried the Berry Alixir flavor and it's pretty darn good. Taste-wise it very-good for a zero-calorie drink. Just a heads up though, if you drink it straight from the can, it might be a tad too sweet so I prefer to dilute it with ice. There are 200 mg of caffeine per can (which is higher than Monster but lower than Bang Energy of respective sizes) Personally it's a plus for me but just be aware that it's on a higher side. Overall, I'd give AminoLean Berry Alixir a solid 4.5 stars. It ticks all the boxes: good taste, zero sugar, potent caffeine, and just a small tweak needed if you prefer it less sweet. Read more | 5.0\nALIX EARLE IS A GIRLS GIRL FOR THIS! I have tried so many energy drinks, pre workouts, coffee, and gum to try to have energy. This energy drink is so yummy ! You truly are paying for the best at a really good price. I keep my fridge stocked with these because of how good they are ! Read more | 5.0\nI really enjoyed this energy drink! I did not experience any negative side effects like jitters or rapid heart beat, which I typically do experience when I have a full energy drink. It gave me just enough energy to get through the mid-day hump and go spend time with friends later in the night. I also have used it as a preworkout drink, and it definitely helped me have the energy to get through the work out. I did not notice a “crash” after. I like that the ingredients are clean as well and not too much sugar. I did not love the berry flavor though and noticed a weirs after taste, so I would probably purchase another flavor next time. Read more | 4.0\nI recently ordered the AminoLean Energy Drink and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Not only did it taste great, but it also provided me with the perfect amount of energy to power through my workouts and get me through the workday. Regarding the taste, it was very refreshing & not too sweet or artificial - there is no sugar added, no high fructose corn syrup, no artificial coloring. During workouts, I felt it gave me a sustained energy boost, even through the toughest parts of my routine. When I used AminoLean during the workday, I found it to be just as effective. It gave me that extra boost I needed to power through my tasks, and I felt more alert and focused. I didn't experience any jitters or crashes like I have with some other energy drinks & alternatives like coffee, etc. Overall, I highly recommend AminoLeanfor anyone looking for a tasty & effective energy boost alternative! Read more | 5.0\nI like the way this energy drink makes me feel throughout the day. It gives a great amount of caffeine and I’m noticeably more productive when I drink it. However, I’ve tried multiple flavors and they’re all so so so sweet. It’s like they dumped too much artificial sweetener in there. Just a warning for those who don’t like super sweet drinks! Read more | 3.0\nI would’ve never guessed this product had no sugar in it. I’m still having a hard time believing it doesn’t because of how sweet it tastes. The bubblyness and flavor is absolutely perfect. The fact that it is a vegan product and I actually like it is quite surprising, as I usually dislike vegan products because they always taste like it’s missing something. I’m pretty young so caffeine doesn’t affect me energy wise, but when my dad tried it, he said it gave him such a boost of energy that when he went on his daily treadmill walk, he was able to stay at speed 4.3 , level 7 incline for a hour straight! I’d honestly buy it again. I feel like it actually may be a healthier alternative to regular energy drinks. Read more | 5.0",

But recently, I discovered Wisdom Tea—a sweet tea instant yerba mate that feels like a healthy, flavorful game-changer. Now, I alternate between the two, creating the ultimate balance of energy and health. Guayakí is perfect for grab-and-go moments, though the sugar content and occasional energy crash can be a downside. Wisdom Tea, on the other hand, is low-sugar, packed with probiotics, and delivers steady, focused energy thanks to its blend of yerba mate, L-theanine, and adaptogens. Together, they’re the dream team—Guayakí for bold, fast energy, and Wisdom Tea for smooth, health-focused stamina. If you’re a yerba mate enthusiast, this duo might just redefine your routine.

There's no artificial sweeteners, which is good because otherwise I wouldn't buy it at all. But they really have too much sugar.  Way too much sugar.

Thank you for both the understanding and the help with resolving the issue professionally; I'll gladly be a repeat customer of this seller. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm a first time purchaser of these here in Amazon. Price was good and fair, product seemed good. The only reason for the 3 stars is that some of the cans arrived damaged and leaked over the rest of the case and box. I don't typically have to contact a seller but if someone could reach out to me, I'd appreciate it and I'd gladly amend my review. Read more | 5.0",

They are energy drinks and will give you a similar buzz and vibration in your bones. From personal experience: do not drink if you are dehydrated, the shakes are so much worse. that said, flavor wise they're quite nice and miss out on the chemical taste a lot of canned coffees seem to have that hit in the back of the throat. I have never had issue of these arriving expired, but if you live in warmer climates it may be possible they go bad. They do contain some milk products.

I bought a few flavors , this is about the Fruit Punch in particular as it's a very common flavor amongst energy drinks . The first sip gave me an immediate hint of grain cereal smell , a smell that I personally love . It is not carbonated so it's smooth going down . The fruity flavor is strong and pleasant . It's got a lot of flavor going on for only 35 calories . The only slight aftertaste that I get is again of grain cereal and it's very light . I like these a lot , recommended . Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor isn’t fruit punch, bland and kind of metal flavor. Not impressed. I will not be purchasing it again. Sorry Read more | 1.0\nThis is an energy drink that has lots of energy and lots of flavor. It tastes and drinks like fruit juice. The fruit punch flavor was absolutely delicious. Reminded me of the fruit punch I used to drink as a kid, but without sugar. I drank it in the morning and stayed focused and energized pretty much the entire day. Looking forward to trying the other flavors. Read more | 5.0\nI had really high hopes for this one, excited that it is non-carbonated and figured it would be great for mornings.  The flavor isn't terrible and it's smooth but it has such a powerful herbal/vitamin smell and taste that completely overpowers any orange or mango flavor.  Kinda struggling to drink them. I mean it does the trick with more caffeine than most energy drinks, but man that herbal taste and smell just kinda wrecks it for me. Read more | 2.0\nSmells like pee that's been sitting around a while. Taste isn't awful but the smell makes it undrinkable really. Read more | 1.0\nSo this product isn’t bad per se. I gave it 3 stars (it’s more like 3.5), but it could easily be 4 star. I prefer uncarbonated energy drinks but most are lower on the caffeine content, so I was glad to see one with 260 mg for those days when I need a little more oomph. Where this product goes wrong is in the taste which could be a death sentence for an energy drink. While I don’t mind the taste, it’s a little cough syrupy and will easily turn off some consumers. The big problem with the taste is really the result of there being whey protein in this product. It changes the texture and gives it an off taste. Hard to describe but if you’ve ever had a liquid protein drink (think fruit drink not protein shake), you know the taste I’m talking about. If it was giving me 10-20 grams of protein, I might be ok to overlook the weird taste as it’s expected, but this product contains only 3 grams??? What’s the point?? It’s totally unnecessary and I think removing it would do wonders for the overall taste. What benefit am I really getting from 3 grams of protein? All that being said, I still kinda like it and have bought it a few times. And if it ever comes back in stock, I’d probably buy it again. I prefer the fruit punch over the tropical (I haven’t tried the other flavor) even if it tastes like protein cough syrup. I just hope the manufacturer reads these reviews because I see I’m not the only person to call out the protein taste. Take it out and I think you’d have a much superior product to market. But that’s just my opinion. Read more | 3.0\nI bought this for what it does - good energy, plus some protein, and zero sugar - and it does that, so I am happy. Taste is perfectly reasonable. I'm not looking for a decadent cocktail. I want energy, plus protein, with zero sugar. Read more | 5.0\nTastes mostly like powdery protein. Did not like the flavor of this at all - couldn't taste the orange/mango over the overpowering taste of powdery protein. If they left the Protein out it might taste better, and 3g of Protein doesn't seem worth it for the bad taste. Would not buy again. Read more | 1.0",

I have trouble finding these around me and saw a good sale for them on Amazon.  Buying a case of them comes out to a better price than individually at the store by at least a dollar.  So that is a great value. What I didn’t like is while they are shipped shrink wrapped as shown in the product listing photos, they came in an additional amazon box but when I opened them the cans are all dented.  They are dented in places you wouldn’t expect as well.  There was no leaking and nothing ruptured, just oddly dented cans.

I had to go to the G Fuel site itself in order to figure out what this is.  Apparently, it's supposed to be \"rainbow candy\" flavor. It is a candy flavor, but it's strange.  If I think \"rainbow candy\" I think of things like Skittles, Starburst, or Life Savers or something like that.  It's not close to any of those to me anyway, instead it's this weird artificial candy flavor, as odd as that sounds.  Perhaps an artificial fruit flavor(s) mixed with a hint of coconut?  It's hard to describe and not what I expected. It's not so terrible that I can't drink it---I hate wasting stuff---but I would not buy this again.

Read more | 5.0\nUpdate to initial review: Aspire customer service contacted me and went above and beyond to make this right.  I really appreciated the follow up! Initial Review: One can is bad and there is something on top of another can.  The product itself is good.  I am disappointed that I spent so much money and one of the cans is damaged. Giving it 4 stars because I’ve had the product previously and it tastes great.  Upset at the cost and having a damaged can. Read more | 3.0\nI like the taste and the new can design.

I ordered these energy drinks after trying others and loved the taste of these! Read more | 5.0\nThe combination of salt/theanine/caffeine is perfect. I am somewhat sensitive to caffeine so I can't do the usual energy drinks with 225 MGs and freaking 200% DV of Niacin, but this is PERFECT. I feel focused but smooth at the gym, I get zero come down, and it's zero calorie.

Opened the first oneI believe it was Mexican lime it had no flavor at all, ok so next day I try the white peach same no flavor.  Have tried all the flavors in my pack not a fan the taste and price definitely didn't work for me.  If you don't like flavor and can drink what tastes like straight carbonation then this is for you.  I will stick with Red Bull it tastes so much better and the energy was much better.

    "reviews": "Strawberry Lemonade Original Blue Raz Super great taste the carbonation is not super high so they don't really explode the caffeine content is amazing I will definitely be buying these again I highly recommend if you want a great tasting energy drink that'll get your and your energy up I didn't have any Jitters from this and it was amazing I would recommend only drinking one a day though Read more | 5.0\nI’m at the point of my life where I can’t just wake up in the morning and have all kinds of energy so I was looking for something in addition to a caffeine pill I take right before the gym. I find myself getting tired in the mid afternoon around 2 or 3 PM. This is my first time ever hearing of this drink, and after reading all the reviews, I gave it a shot. I opened one up on a Saturday and drank it around 10 AM. I was preparing myself to maybe feel some kind of jitters or something like that but nothing at all! In fact, it was a nice smooth ramp up to where I felt a lot more energized and focused, but it was not over the top. It’s more like a sustained energy level for most of the day. I highly recommend this drink and I will be putting in my routine order from now on. I don’t think I’ll need it every single day but probably 3 to 4 days a week. I will definitely drink it and enjoy the fact that I don’t feel tired at 3:30 in the afternoon anymore. I agree with my fellow reviewers that the taste is actually really good! That surprised me the most. I had a tall glass with two big ice cubes. Let it get nice and cold and it was no problem drinking it. Great taste and great aftertaste. Unlike other energy drinks that taste like trash. Read more | 5.0\nTaste is good 4/5 Caffeine content is great 5/5 Price is fair 4/5 Recommendation? Yes, I would totally recommend this to anybody that drinks energy drinks often. It is on the stronger side but for the price.. you can't really beat it. Try it out! :) Read more | 5.0\nGreat taste and caffeine but has a high price tag. Read more | 4.0\nThe taste? Fantastic. Energy boost? Unlike any other energy drink I’ve tried. I am not someone who loves jitters & was so relieved that it does NOT give me that despite the high caffeine content. I was very skeptical at first but after about 9 subscribe & save orders later, it’s safe to say I am convinced. I know there are other flavor options, but I found the one i’m sticking with. Try it & you won’t regret it! Read more | 5.0\nThis delivers a real kick when you drink it and it lasts for hours. Read more | 5.0\nDecided to try this energy drink hoping to gain some energy when working out. Really have a hard time with running an needed a little boost. I’ve tried Monster,Bang,Sixstar. You name it I’ve tried it. Saw this had a greater amount of caffeine then those other drinks so I figured I’d give it a shot. Drunk half like recommend to see how it would work. It did nothing! So the next day I drink an entire can waited and waited an still nothing. There’s no type of carbonation the flavor is sweet but manageable. Overall in my opinion I wouldn’t recommend buying this drink. Feel like it was a really big waste of money. The stars are simply based on flavor and the fast shipping. Read more | 1.0\nI loved Brandon loved the idea that I could get three different flavors because the original and the strawberry pink lemonade I think it is I remember off the top of my head are both absolutely amazing I'll buy them on Amazon I'll buy them in store wherever I can find them but the blue raspberry fell short well let's be honest it felt flat on its face it's still a value for the money cuz of the caffeine content yeah it's pop top it's easy to use the cans look cool but the flavor is just not good it's I don't know what's missing this doesn't taste good their sugar-free like  always and Spike makes quality product but they just got the flavor wrong I actually gave out half this case trying to make sure it wasn't like it me thinking it was weird or not everyone thought it was not right flavor and so like I said it appeared to be a good idea it was a good looking package of them but it just doesn't work for me it made for you but to me it just doesn't and it can't get much easier you order it cut the plastic pop the top and go about doing your work Read more | 3.0",

Caffeine content just right for me. I only drink half a can a day and it supplies enough energy to get me going on days I don’t have time to make coffee Read more | 5.0\nTastes good, quality ingredients and kept me awake to finish term papers overnight. Read more | 5.0\nIf you're anything like me, you have a busy life, and getting 8+ hours of sleep every night just doesn't happen. You need something to get through your day, and the proliferation of mass-market energy drinks has led you to chugging one, two, three or even more in a day! Not good! I know my own Bed Rull (clever!) drinking was getting out-of-control, and it was having a serious impact on both my health and my wallet. In my desperation for a source of healthier, more cost and eco friendly energy, I turned to my local natural grocery store and found this: GURU Lite. Made with Stevia instead of all those \"let's all wait for the news story about the horrible health impacts\" artificial sweeteners, and containing only ingredients you can actually pronounce (sparking water, lemon juice, cane juice, guarana seed, luo han gua juice, steevia, echinacea, ginko, ginseng)it sounded pretty promising. But what about the energy? Well it works, I took my first sip, went \"oh well, crap, doesn't work\" and then 2 minutes later I was awake! No jitters, no \"surge-o-epic caffeine\" - just awake. It's refreshing, if you're used to the \"wired wired wired wired zing zoom bzzzzz crash!\" of normal energy drinks, get ready for one that actually just makes you feel like yourself. Not wired, not tired, not cranky, not crazy, just a couple extra hours of focus as YOU! But what about the flavor? GURU Lite is best described as \"not bad\", I like it room temperature, you may prefer it chilled. Unlike those commercial heart-attacks-in-a-can, GURU focused on health over sugar-load, so expect a slightly lemony, earthy herbal taste. It is not by an means bad tasting, but it's not like liquid candy, it's a simple, natural flavor that doesn't overwhelm or make you want to chug twenty of them. You drink this for the health and energy, and the taste is secondary. I don't want you to think \"oh it tastes bad...\" because it doesn't, it's just the taste is definitely not the focus, it's not a soda, it's more like a glass of water - you drink it because you're thirsty, and this, you drink because you are tired and want to be awake. What about the cost? Well, Amazon has the best deal around. I chose the subscribe-and-save option and came home to find a box, wrapped in a clear plastic wrap to protect against rain, two days later. Inside was my case of GURU (which looks exactly like the picture). I found with GURU not only am I drinking fewer of them than I did with Bed Rull, but I'm able to sleep better and of course I'm ending each month with tons of cash in my pocket that is no longer being spent on over-priced, junk-laden commercial \"energy\". And the best part? I have all the energy I want at hand in a far, far healthier package. Give it a shot today, you will be pleasantly surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI don’t typically like sparkling drinks. They are hard to drink. They tend to make me feel bloated, and usually they taste terrible because they’re meant to be on the lighter side, calorie wise. For example, Celsius sparkling drinks. I LOVE the non carbonates drinks they make! But the sparkling/carbonation side of them make them hard to enjoy, and the taste is not as good as their non carbonated drinks. If you’ve tried them, you know what I mean. These drinks are also sparkling, but somehow they aren’t as “carbonated” feeling and tasting! Impressive! They have a perfect balance for that effect. Makes it easier to chug when I’m in a hurry. Was also worried about the taste! I’ve never tasted Yerba mate, so I was expecting a very strong earthy taste. It mostly taste like a delicate mint taste with a mild “artificial” sweetening aftertaste and a hint of tea. Seriously impressed. Usually when you see all these healthier ingredients you know it’s good for you, or better for you anyways, but you know it’s probably not going to taste very good. One example of a “lighter” drink such as this one, or similar anyways as far as the use of “better ingredients” in the product, is the jocko willink energy drink. In the ingredients list, you will see things that will make you feel better about drinking the product. But it doesn’t taste good at all. This drink has great ingredients and balanced use of them to give it just enough taste and carbonation, to enjoy. I’m amazed with this product and will buy two more of these cases. I regret not getting the variety packs at sams when they did carry them, because I want to try the other flavors. Give these a shot if you so t mins a light tasting, light carbonation effect energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI wasted $50.00 on an unsuspecting change in recipe that showed up at my door.  The GURU original use to be AMAZING, now it takes like overly sweet artificial crap.  There was no warning on this change, so BEWARE.

The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to! The flavor is AMAZING! Energy is AMAZING! And it’s perfect for someone on keto looking for an energy boost! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n3.0\n5.0\n4.0",

    "reviews": "Wild Berry Watermelon Mint Grapefruit Blood Orange Blackberry Vanilla I like this drink but would love to see more flavors. How about grape, strawberry and chocolate (everything else the same, only the flavor changes)? It’s nice to have a quick organic energy boost option available that has zero sugar of any kind. I wish these would be available even in my local grocery store. Thanks HiBall! Read more | 5.0\nAlthough a bit spendy, it's worth every penny, as  each can is a generous-sized 16 oz and the quality of ingredients is equally impressive.  This lovely vanilla energy seltzer has a clean, vanilla-infused flavor with no aftertaste.  For vanilla lovers, the strong flavor-infusion trumps any desire for sweetness - it's pure vanilla!  With 160mg organic caffeine, 50mg organic guarana, and 50mg organic ginseng, one can will give you energy that lasts for most of the day.  It's definitely a keeper! Read more | 5.0\nI remember getting this years ago and it tasted much better, had more carbonation, and the energy felt a lot more like a regular caffeinated beverage. I don't know what crap they're putting in this new version of Hi-ball energy but 6 or so hours after consuming this stuff I started to feel super flat, anxious, heart began to race, and I became dizzy. Felt similar to a panic attack or something. I can usually consume pretty sizeable amounts of caffeine but for some reason this drink now has made me feel like this 3 times in a row. I will never drink this stuff again because it is not \"clean energy\", it is CRAP energy. Read more | 1.0\nThe absolute best energy drink out there! We were SUPER bummed when the original was discontinued and I was hesitant to think that a new formulation could match then former. The new manufacturer has done a great job! Great taste and without the crash that comes from a lot of energy drinks. Read more | 5.0\nI love that this is just bubble water, a nice flavor essence and caffeine. No weird stuff, no disgusting tasting vitamins, no even more disgusting tasting fake sugar. Yes, stevia is fake sugar and tastes just as gross as the chemical ones. Read more | 5.0\nI used to buy these at Ralph's up until a year or so ago. Unfortunately Anheuser-Busch discontinued this brand several years after acquiring it from the original, \"grassroot\" creators. Now it's owned/operated by Tilray Brands, based in NY. My first observation is that it seems slightly less carbonated and less flavored than I recall. Keep in mind HiBall's appeal was its' clean, sugar-free, lightly flavored recipe, along with a medium-dose of caffiene, at 160mgs. (400 milligrams is the FDA cutoff. Anymore than 200 in one day might blow my adrenal system out and induce a cardiac event) But it just seems a little lighter in carbonation and flavor than I recall. Still good, though. Wild Berry was always my go-to. I'm not sure if Tilray is cutting corners on ingredients, or even the aluminum cans, but I will order some other flavors to test myself. In the meantime, I'm fairly happy to recommend if you're not in the mood for the many zombie-piss and depleted uranium-based caffeine drinks out there. Cheers. Read more | 4.0\nCan’t understand why they stopped selling in stores & gyms…  this was hands down the best energy drink ever. So refreshing, no gross “sweet” flavor like other “healthy sugar free” energy drinks, perfect level of carbonation unlike the “barely carbonated” drinks… really great product Read more | 5.0\nVery disappointed in the blackberry flavor.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Tropical Thrill Son of a Peach Rizzberry and Cream Red Ryder Punch Orange Drizzle Bodacious Berry OG Luck When I performed a search for energy drinks, Lucky Energy appeared as a sponsored result. Curious to learn more, I clicked on it. I was moved by the creators backstory and why Lucky energy became a thing. Upon looking at the range of flavor profiles offered, I went with the variety pack. However, at an almost eye watering $30 for just 10 cans, I was hesitant at first but nonetheless they arrived the next day. Again, love the backstory but also the packaging/design of everything. To me, this is a well put together brand with the different flavors offered and the design of the can. Everyone always asks me what I'm drinking. All in all I like the drink so far, I haven't tried all the flavors just yet but have tried 3 so far and all of them have tasted clean, crisp, and delicious. Not overly sweet like some low sugar/sugar free drinks are with all that fake sweetener and whatnot. This is just right. The only con I can say is the price. Coming in at $3/can is a little higher some might argue. That's what you'd normally pay at a gas station. I'm used to paying anywhere between $1.50/$2 a can when ordering online in bulk. However, at the end of the day this seems to be still a new product and maybe prices will change and times goes on and they get bigger, things get more affordable for them, etc. I can get behind paying the little extra though because I feel good about supporting someone with such a memorable backstory and purpose for a product. I would give these a try if you haven't. Very good and will probably be ordering more at a later date. Read more | 5.0\nMove over Rockstar, Redbull, and Monster. There’s a new king in town, and its name is Lucky Energy. That’s right, I said it: best energy drink out there. And trust me, I’m not throwing that title around lightly as someone who’s basically an energy drink connoisseur. What sets Lucky Energy apart is that it’s made with clean ingredients. Unlike most energy drinks that leave you feeling guilty for what you’re putting into your body, this one feels like a smarter choice. I get all the benefits—energy, focus, and even a surprising mood boost, without that nagging \"am I slowly destroying myself?\" feeling. The energy is smooth, too. There’s no crash, which is honestly a game-changer. I can power through my day without suddenly feeling like I got hit by a truck. Plus, it’s so good that I ended up buying six cases after trying it. Yeah, it’s that good. And the best part? It’s actually cheaper than the big-name brands you find in liquor stores. If you’re looking for an energy drink that works, tastes great, and doesn’t come with a side of regret, Lucky Energy is your answer. Do yourself a favor and stock up, you won’t regret it. Read more | 5.0\nI loved this energy drink, the flavor, size of can and price was reasonable.  Now I go back to buy it again and the flavor is not available in the 19oz can, which is fine because I'm patient and they will restock, but then I see they hiked up the price 10 dollars a 12 pack and the 16oz cans cost 5 dollars more than the original price for the bigger can.  If you find something you like at a great price buy as many as you can cause it's never gonna go down.  Now I can't afford this anymore.  On to the next one.  Happens with everything.  I understand a dollar even 2 but 10.  That's when it's time to move on.  When this happens company's are saying to me, greed is more important than long term loyalty to customer base.  Bait and switch on a lot of products I'm noticing. Read more | 4.0\nThese are my new favorite and goto energy drinks. The OG Luck flavor is really good—not too sweet and no weird aftertaste like so many others I’ve tried. It gives a nice boost of energy without making me feel jittery or crashing later. I like that it has 200mg of caffeine and added ingredients like maca and ginseng for an extra kick. Overall, it’s a solid energy drink that tastes great and works well. Definitely worth trying if you’re looking for a healthier option! Read more | 5.0\nLove the flavor of the organs cream and definitely feel the energy.  Also love the story of the owner of the company Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is okay but has a brewed after taste. Better tasting energy drinks out there for the same or better price. Read more | 3.0\nI dont like coffee particularly but I like a little kick in the mornings so naturally energy drinks have always been my go to. I don't like the high caffeine content of some of them though, there is a such thing as too much buzz. It has a good amount of caffeine but not too much and the ingredients are a lot more basic than others. I like the fact that they use vegetable juice for their colors instead of the nasty food coloring. They seem to be right in line price wise with everybody else. These will be my new go to, from dirt bikes to surfing to work. Read more | 5.0\nOg luck taste great! Taste just like a green monster but with out all the junk monster has in it. You can definitely tell after you've drank a can, it does have a slight taste of the zero sugar but nothing to noticeable after my first can I hardly noticed it. No bad aftertaste doesn't make me jittery and I don't feel like crashing out either. Overall i would definitely recommend this energy drink to anyone willing to give it a shot. I've only tried the og luck so I can't comment on the other flavors but OG Luck is a must try if you like the taste of the green monsters. 4 out of 5 stars because the pricing could be a little cheaper other than that I've seen people complain about damaged cans i haven't had that problem yet my packaging was perfect and was delivered on time. Also this is not a paid review I just wanted to share my experience. Update: Second shipment over half the cans are damaged. Read more | 4.0",

So as someone who had gestational diabetes, this was a great drink to add to my daily intake. Just 1 a day will get you results. Read more | 5.0\nI’m no expert on sports drinks so I can’t really speak to the ingredients or compare them to other similar products but like so many others, I struggle to drink as much water as recommended and know that I feel much better in every way when I can stay hydrated. My son turned me on to Body Armor and I thought it was delicious. I love sugary drinks and Coca Cola is my guilty pleasure. I drink quite a bit of it despite knowing that it is terrible for me in several ways. I started out with the regular flavors but decided to try the Lyte variety because they have almost no calories for the entire bottle. I can down on of these puppies in a few minutes where it takes me an hour to nurse a bottle of plain water. I’m no athlete but I do work out and these drinks are great at quenching thirst and I’m hoping that the ingredients are replenishing to my body. The Peach Mango is my favorite flavor but honestly I have not found one that I don’t like! Even better, they are reasonably priced on Amazon and cheaper than they are at my local grocery store even when they are on sale. I hesitate to post this glowing review because I don’t want to run out if everyone runs to snap them up. I have the PM flavor on auto-delivery and last night, after reading a bunch of reviews, ordered a few more flavors to have on hand for variety. With Body Armor Lyte I have a beverage that keeps me able to drink the recommended amount of fluid daily while not feeling guilty for the empty calories or spending a fortune. I am a huge fan of this product. I hope they never stop making it and that Amazon continues to make it available at an affordable price. UPDATE:  I just got my shipment of the Coconut flavor and if it’s possible I like it even BETTER than the Peach Mango and I haven’t even tried the Strawberry Lemonade yet. Someone had said these were 40 calories a bottle but it looks to me like there is only one serving per bottle making them only 20 calories for the whole bottle Either way a winner in my book. These things are the easiest way I have ever found to hydrate. Amazon don’t stop carrying these and don’t quadruple the price. Enough said. Read more | 5.0\nBODYARMOR LYTE Sports Drink is amazing! The Blueberry Pomegranate flavor is refreshing and delicious, and it’s packed with natural flavors and electrolytes. As an athlete, I love the low-calorie, hydrating boost it provides, especially with the added coconut water and potassium. It keeps me energized without the sugar crash. Perfect for workouts or any active day—highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nSo I saw the hype about BodyArmor Lyte boosting breast milk supply, and I’ll admit, I was curious. Full disclosure: My baby’s exclusively breastfed, so I didn’t see any major changes in supply, but the flavor? Honestly, it’s pretty good—refreshing, not too sweet, and definitely a better option than another cup of lukewarm water. If you forget to hydrate like I do, this is a solid backup. It’s a nice way to sneak in some hydration while juggling everything else. Read more | 5.0\nIt's  hard to find good beverages these days, after Bai completely changed their formula, and everything  else is so high. My top choice is Zero Banana  Strawberry,  but this one is a deal for 6,  20 ounce bottles. Body Armour makes drinks you can taste! Good for diabetics. Read more | 5.0\nBody armor is a fantastic hydration drink especially if you’re looking for lower sugar. This flavor is good but not necessarily my favorite. Still it was a great value and would buy again at that price but maybe keen to trying a new flavor. I would love a variety pack but haven’t been able to find one. Quality drink to keep you going Read more | 4.0\nI keep this on hand for my own use daily and for my 36 YO son's use when he visits. Excellent taste, good size, and calorie-wise. Excellent for hydrating when in a project and don't want to stop to make a meal. Read more | 5.0\nsweetened with stevia and low calorie, might affect individuals differently, but does not raise my blood sugar so I will keep using this as long as the formula does not change.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar.

Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

Read more | 4.0\nEver since I discovered these energy drinks, they have become a part of every morning. I don’t feel that I need to have one, like coffee, or other stimulant type of caffeine drink. I just like the taste, and the way that it energizes and starts my morning. One issue to be aware of of course is the fact that five hour energy does contain niacin. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just important to note that you should not drink the entire bottle all at once, particularly if you have had any type of low blood blood pressure problem  in the past, or you are taking medication for blood pressure. The niacin may cause a niacin rush as it is known and this may make you feel a little faint. Some people have actually reported that they drank the entire bottle and then fainted for a moment onto the floor.  The bottle itself warns against this and does indicate that you should not drink the entire bottle all at once. For me, I break it up into three parts I take a drink and then perhaps get dressed or take a shower then I drink another third, and perhaps read the daily newspaper  or answer email and then by the time I get into the car after about 30 or 40 minutes I drink the final third of the bottle. That is perfect for me no effects no dizziness and I am fully energized for the morning some of the flavors are not real wonderful, so choose the one that you like the best. For me it is the berry.

    "reviews": "The Strawberry-Banana flavor of this 5-Hour Energy shot is the best of ANY of them!  And I have tried them ALL!! I like that this isn't a drink that you have to down 12 ounces to get full effect, AND it isn't a \"caffeine high\", but rather a B-12 Vitamin buzz!! I love that it kicks in in under 5 minutes and I'm moving just a bit faster in the morning because I'm not falling asleep at the sink brushing my teeth or whatever the morning routine is.  I was helping run a political campaign for almost a year and I would never have been able to get up every day at the crack of dawn after working all night the night before, if it weren't for this product. And you can stop using it without any type of withdrawal symptoms.  You can fall asleep while taking it if the opportunity arises for a quick nap to recharge your body and brain, without laying there tapping your toes or fingers or whatever. Great product, only 4 calories and caffeine amount from ONE cup of coffee.  The rest is all B-Vitamins!! Read more | 5.0\nI have tried many flavors, over the years, and they all are just ok.

Khaotic, Pipeline Punch, Pacific Punch, etc? Are you curious to know if this is worth your time and money? Well rest easy friend, I’m here to tell you all about Rio Punch! It’s fine. There it is. It’s perfectly serviceable. It does not have a bad taste or an after taste in my opinion. But compared to those other juice monsters, which are sweet and have a very pronounced taste, Rio Punch just is. My wife said it tasted like a stale tangerine. I kind of agree, but not in a bad stale tangerine kind of way. I kind of feel it tastes like a slightly sweetened water with fizz. In conclusion, if the prices are out of control, as they usually are, and you need your monster, and Rio Punch is a lower price, it will work just fine. Just don’t expect to be blown away.

Do take note the name of this flavor is super misleading, judging by it, I was expecting this to end up being a slightly different sour heads variant, but to my surprise and happiness, these actually just straight up taste like artificial mango. Someone else said peach and I strongly disagree as someone who hates peach flavored drinks. If this flavor sticks around, I'm really hoping they opt to change the name instead of the recipe.

Blue razz is horrible, cotton candy tastes half as good as it used to and so does the purple haze. I mean really, it’s just sad man. Now I have an entire case I’m throwing in the trash.

    "reviews": "Strawberry Watermelon Glacier Freeze 3-Flavor Variety Pack Cool Blue I’ve had close to 60 orders of 24-pack redbulls from Amazon on every two weeks delivery for a long time now. I work shift work and live on caffeine. A coworker had some of these and I tried it out. Little to no sugar, 200mg caffine vs 120mg and a great refreshing taste to boot! I now have had 6 deliveries of these on two week auto order. I’m a big fan of these. I miss my redbulls taste, but these are a better alternative for long term users like myself. I will say, the orange is not my favorite. But this pack is best priced most competitive. Read more | 5.0\nIn my opinion these are the best energy drink out there currently. I don’t have a lot of time in the mornings to sip a carbonated energy drink or make coffee, so grabbing one of these and being able to drink it quickly while I’m driving to work is a huge win. I don’t feel sick after drinking it and it doesn’t give me digestive issues either. I love that these also use natural color sources for the food coloring- the glacier freeze uses blueberry juice which also tastes great too. I can’t find them in stores near me anymore so I always order them through here. Read more | 5.0\nI tried several of the flavors when they hit the store and found myself buying a couple every time I went so I finally ordered a case. The Strawberry Watermelon is my favorite but some people may find them on the sweet/syrupy tasting side. The energy you get though (200MG Caffeine) is clean as there's no sugar in this drink to make you crash. Low calorie and low sodium is great too. Not all drinks are created equal, I've tried some brands that advertise 300MG of caffeine in the drink and however it's formulated, you just don't feel it. You do with this drink though, I drink it in the morning before the gym most days and it gives me a good amount of energy without some side affects traditional pre-workouts can have. I also like that it's a little bottle VS a can that way if I am in the car or carrying it to the gym and it's already opened I don't have to worry about spilling it, however because of that design it does not stay cold as long. Definitely going to be my go to drink for awhile! Read more | 5.0\nI'm not a coffee drinker, and I don't love carbonated drinks in the AM.  Gatorade Fast Twitch gives me my morning caffeine and tastes delicious in the process.  My favorite flavors are grape and strawberry watermelon. I had a really hard time with Celcius making me dizzy, and Monster making me really shaky, but Fast Twitch has a nice smooth delivery of the caffeine and is ridiculously easy to drink. I love it before an afternoon of pickleball just to get that extra edge. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered this product a little over a week ago for $15.98.  within that little bit of time I returned to place another order and the price increased by $7 and now costs $22.98. how did the product increase price by 50% in that short of time? While the product is good, it is way overpriced. These bottles are only 12 oz each and not worth almost $2 per bottle.  Lower the price and I will continue to buy. As for now, the product tasted good but the price increase left a bad taste in my mouth Read more | 4.0\nI never bothered with energy drinks.  I was always a Dr Pepper girl, but wanted to find an option for some mid-day energy without all the calories.  I started looking around to see what was out there, and saw this non-carbonated option that had a few flavors that I may potentially like.  I found a local place where I could buy single bottles and tried both the Strawberry Watermelon (my two favorite fruit flavors combined into one - a rare find!) and Strawberry Lemonade.  The Strawberry Lemonade one wasn't bad, but I loved the Strawberry Watermelon flavor right away and have been ordering these cases of it ever since. Read more | 5.0\nThis is by far the best energy drink ever made.  Unfortunately it's discontinued Read more | 5.0\nThese taste just like regular Gatorade which is impressive considering the 0 sugar! But weirdly they still have the same syrupy sugar feel and taste that the regular drinks do as well. My husband likes the flavor but can only handle it in small amounts because of the intense syrupy taste and how it coats your mouth. Personally I don't mind it! A big positive is the caffeine and B6/B12 boost without carbonation. These really do get us through the day as well as any other energy drink we've tried and it's very nice to have an option that isn't carbonated. A big negative is that a lot (not all) of the caps are EXTREMELY difficult to get off. And not just a perforation issue, but even once perforated from the ring, the caps still won't turn because they are so tight. I've never had to do battle with a regular Gatorade bottle to get it open, so I'm not sure what's going on with these. Overall, I would give these 4 stars and my husband would give them a 2, so rounding to a 3 stars! I think it would be an easy 4 stars if we didn't have to STRUGGLE with half the bottles just to drink them. (my palm is currently red and sore from trying repeatedly to get one bottle open that I eventually put back in the fridge for my husband to deal with, so I'm a little salty over the stupid caps atm).

    "reviews": "Tropical Punch Strawberry Grape Strawberry Banana Pineapple Coconut Orange Mango Fruit Punch Cherry Lime Blue Raspberry Blackout Berry I recently tried the BODYARMOR Sports Drink, Tropical Punch flavor, and it quickly became a staple in my daily routine. This drink not only tastes great with its tropical flavors, but it also provides incredible hydration benefits, thanks to the coconut water and a blend of vitamins and potassium-packed electrolytes. As a breastfeeding mom, hydration is crucial, and I've found that BODYARMOR significantly supports my milk supply. The combination of nutrients and electrolytes helps keep me hydrated throughout the day, which is vital for maintaining and boosting milk production. I appreciate that this drink is formulated free from artificial additives, making it a much better choice compared to many other sports drinks on the market. The 16 Fl Oz bottle size is perfect for on-the-go hydration, and the pack of 12 ensures that I always have a refreshing drink available when I need it. Whether I'm at home, out running errands, or taking a walk with the baby, BODYARMOR has been a reliable companion when I’m bored with drinking plain water. I recommend at least trying this for breastfeeding moms looking for a great tasting and effective way to stay hydrated and support their milk supply.

My partner came out of the hospital and was advised by his Dr to get something in order to stay well hydrated. We both loved these and have now subscribed. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve always been a fan of Body Armors and the different types of flavors they released, my top favorites being between Blue Raspberry, Strawberry Banana, and Blackout Berry which all fight for first place! This time around, I purchased myself a case of Blue Raspberry and was more than pleased when it had arrived. There was zero damage, tampering, nor any issues present with the bottles or the case itself, as well as being just as I had expected it. I’ve never ordered them online though, so the quantity I received for the price I bought them at was well worth it due to it being significantly cheaper, by a long shot, on Amazon then what it is in stores. The one thing to always remind yourself of though since it’s a sports drink is that it contains a lot of things from vitamins to electrolytes. So it’s definitely recommended to not drink heavy amounts of it even if you have a lot, as some nauseating side effects like headaches, slight stomach sickness, as well as throat irritation can occur. Overall? It’s a really great product I see myself getting in large quantities again through Amazon rather than in-person stores because of the better pricing as well as accessible variety in stock. Being something I’d recommend as well to others who may be interested in something with good flavors as well as benefits. The one thing I wish is that I could find more like it, such as Strawberry Banana, minus all of the electrolytes and factors that force your hand in not drinking so much. As there are many different brands with the same flavor in mind, but they don’t hit that exact mark that I look for that Body Armors do. Read more | 4.0\nUse to be a Gatorade drinker switched to this when my friend started working for them and he would bring them to our softball games and have not ever thought about switching back.  Great taste and less added sugars.  I try to but them when they go on sale you use to be able to get the 20oz 6 pack at a $1 a bottle now that is harder to find so usually you can get the 16oz 12 pack for $1 a bottle Read more | 5.0\nLove all the fun flavors!

Perfect before bed! I would not want to get behind the wheel after drinking these 😂 Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely LOVE the berry flavor of this beverage!!!  It has become my favorite drink and has replaced my nightly cocktail.  I prefer to drink it in a glass with ice, but enjoying out of the can is nice as well.  With only 10 calories and a great taste, I can enjoy it in the evening while relaxing before bed.  I always take a while to fall asleep, but I do feel that the magnesium and chamomile may be aiding in my sound sleep throughout the night.  There was a huge price jump that I was disappointed to see; hoping it goes back down soon. Read more | 5.0\nBrain Blend was where its at for me with the apple kiwi flavor. I needed the extra focus, and I can say the taste was there. I get a bit goldfish, and this was definitely the morning start I needed. One can is the equivalent to a cup of coffee. I can't get on the iced coffee kick, but I can with Tru less of heart palpitations, and more of tummy butterflies. Pure bliss of every sip starting your day off right! Read more | 5.0\nThe media could not be loaded. This was a tasty and fizzy drink. It was very effective at giving me that boost of energy I needed in the morning. I bought the pack of 12 in the orange mango flavor. One caveat: Although it is a low calorie beverage with no sugar, this drink is not recommended if you are diabetic due to the high glycemic index of Maltodextrin an ingredient listed on this drink. Otherwise, enjoy! This is delicious! Read more | 4.0\nThis seltzer offers a refreshing, light taste with a subtle hint of natural fruit flavor that isn’t overpowering or artificial. The carbonation is crisp and delivers a pleasant fizz without being too intense, making it easy to drink. With no added sugars or sweeteners, it’s a great zero-calorie option for those looking to stay hydrated without the heaviness of sugary drinks. Overall, it’s a well-balanced, versatile seltzer that works perfectly on its own or as a mixer in cocktails, providing a clean and satisfying experience. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been loving this peach-flavored Gutsy Seltzer  and it’s quickly become my go-to while reading by the pool, lounging in the sun, or even after a swim. 🏊‍♀️🍑 What sets it apart? It’s packed with probiotics, prebiotics, and Vitamin B3—all great for supporting gut health, which is a huge plus for me since I struggle with stomach issues. 🙌 Low in sugar, low in calories, and caffeine-free, this seltzer is the ideal guilt-free drink to sip on while chilling out. 💧 Perfectly refreshing with just the right amount of fizz, this sparkling water is a must-try if you’re looking for something light, tasty, and good for your body. 🌿✨ Read more | 5.0\nAll good excepted they doubled the price in less than 30 days. Product and taste is good. A light daily adaptageb drink. Used to buy these at $16, now $39 ($34) with discount. Idk what's happend, but supply demand right? If it went to $19 or even eventually $24. Not strong enough to make a difference to be $39. $19 seems to be fair. Read more | 3.0\nYummy! Much better than soda! Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "My dad has been on the hunt for something to give him a bit more energy lately, so I ordered these with him in mind. I decided to be the guinea pig first to see if anything would actually happen and below is my full experience thus far. I received these Monday the 16th and by the time I took the first half of a bottle I had already been awake for 18hours. I figured being on the verge of when normal people would be getting ready to sleep would be a perfect trial for this. The taste is a bit medicinal but fruity and still surprisingly pretty easy to shoot back. Within the first 15 minutes I noticed I did feel more awake than I was before I took it, but I wasn't highly alert or \"all hopped up on Mountain Dew\" and bouncing off the walls. I went back to working on the project I was doing before I took it and noticed that maybe about 4 hours in I was starting to feel sleepy for a moment, but realized it was simply do to my posture while I was sitting, once I adjusted I was back to the same level I had prior. I have a bad habit that it doesn't matter how awake I am, if I find just that perfect little spot/level of comfort I'll pass out lol. About 3-4 more hours later I decided to give the other half a shot to see if it would do anything or if I'd finally pass out. I stayed awake.... All in all I managed to stay up for 38 hours before finally decided to fall asleep, 20 hours of it was due to the shot. Caving on sleep was definitely allowing myself to get too comfortable again in how I was sitting or I think I would've still stayed up had I gotten up and moved to work on something else. I ended up drifting off peacefully instead of crashing hard or feeling super sleepy and deciding to go to bed. It was a lovely solid 12 hours of sleep though lol. While taking it I never experienced any headaches, nausea, jitters, or over active energy or high alertness. It was a nice even keeled experience that let me continue working like I wanted, like keeping a smidge above a good midday energy level for the entire day instead of just wanting a nap every 3 hours lol. When I slept I felt peaceful and out solid instead of tossing a lot like I do, when I woke up I experienced no grogginess. With things like G-Fuel I noticed an over active amount of energy for awhile and alertness, but it would be sorta short lived and then the come down felt a little harsher. I would also start to feel icky after a bit either with a headache or an upset stomach because I might have consumed too much simply because I liked the taste or because I thought it would give me another boost. Taking straight B12 after awhile has no real effect for energy levels but at least I know I'm topped off there I guess. It's nice that this has a small mix of good vitamins with the B12. Weird to say, but it's nice to find something without taurine in it, can't hear the comment about drinking the inappropriate parts of a bull anymore lol. I'll still have to see what it does for my dad, but at least for me it was a good product, thanks to it I got my project done! :D Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of a coffee drinker and have been cutting out my soda.  But, there are times when I need a boost of energy.  I find myself tired certain times of day, often when I’m at work or running errands. In my research, I came across Vitamin Energy shot. Price was reasonable.  So, I gave it a try.  I didn’t care for other energy products I’ve tried before, so I was skeptical. So far, so good.  The taste is ok.  It is better than most other similar products. More importantly, it seems to be working.  I feel more awake, without the headaches or nervousness.  One small container does the job.  I will continue to use as needed.  Would recommend. Read more | 5.0\nThey do tasty bad, but so does 5hour energy. Two doses per bottle? I don’t think so. They work and they’re cheaper than 5 hour. I chill mine and do them like a shot.  I don’t know how much caffeine is in them but they do work. I gotta say though I do like 5hour energy better.(except for the cost) Read more | 4.0\nI really wanted to like these energy shots, as they are half the price of the big name. They have a little more caffeine, but fewer other ingredients for energy boosting. I could get past that if not for 2 things (so, minus 2 stars): taste and impact on your digestive tract. For the latter concern, let's just say it gets me running, but for the wrong reasons :)  And as to the taste....I don't know how in the world some people say it tastes great (subjective, I guess?) To me, it's like taking sugar free Kool-Aid and mixing it with cough syrup, sans alcohol....no exaggeration. The big name stuff tastes gourmet by comparison. It gives a boost, so I drank mine but will likely use something else. Read more | 3.0\nI have been using Zipfizz Energy Shots for a couple of years and they have been a good source of energy and relief from migraine symptoms. When I discovered that I could no longer get that product (at least in it's original formula), I started looking for a replacement.  When I found Vitamin Energy Shots (VES) I decided to give it a try and have been pleased with the results.  Some reviewers have complained about the taste, but the taste hasn't bothered me at all.  The shots are only 1.97 oz compared with 4 oz Zipfizz, but I think they deliver as well as or even better.  I have been using VES two or three times per week and have found that it really works for me.  Vitamin Energy Shots claims that there are two \"doses\" per bottle.  I'm not sure how that works, but I have been using the whole 1.97 oz each time I have used the product.  I can't say that it delivers 7 hours of energy.  It last me about 5-6 hours and then tapers off. Ounce per ounce I think the price is about the same as Zipfizz.  I had been getting Zipfizz for $42 per 24 bottles and this product is $20 for 12 smaller bottles.  So far Vitamin Energy Shots seem to be a good replacement for Zipfizz.  I am ordering two boxes today. Update:  I have been using Vitamin Energy shot for several weeks now and have found it to be an excellent product, so I changed my rating to 5 stars.  I placed my third order today, but opted to buy the 48 count box because I save 62 cents per bottle that way.  The 12 packs costs 19.95 = 1.66 per bottle.  The 48 pack costs 49.95 = 1.06.  Something to consider. Read more | 5.0\nNot my favorite choice for energy drinks. Had a medicine taste that last for hours, and gave me heartburn Read more | 1.0\nI really enjoy this energy drink with 2 doses per bottle. Tastes great and is a good value for the cost. Read more | 5.0\nIf you find yourself getting drowsy while driving, here is a cheap and inexpensive way to wake you up. Within 5 to 15 minutes of taking half of the bottle, I am more alert, less likely to have an enough accident. One caveat: peel away the top layer so that you can easily open the bottle in the car while you’re driving. The plastic on the cap is not something that you can easily remove while you’re driving. I usually uncap two at a time and keep them near me. Read more | 5.0",

Read more | 5.0\nAfter drinking two redline extreme energy drinks per day for several years, I got worried that they had stopped working/waking me up, despite the ungodly amount of caffeine.  I switched to 5hr energy extra strength for a while but was disgusted at the nearly $4 price that they cost around here even though they worked nearly as well as the redline with less caffeine(I'm guessing other ingredients besides caffeine have an affect) I've tried half a dozen different cheap energy shots from Amazon and have always been disappointed until I found this one. This beats the Kirkland brand, stackers, etc hands down Read more | 5.0\nAfter having tried vitamin energy shots I cannot give it a good review. Usually I buy Kirkland brand but that didn’t have them so decided to try these.

    "reviews": "Watermelon Crush Variety Tropical Original Variety Orange Twist Mango Tango Citrus Burst Cherry Lime Paradise Punch I usually don’t like the typical energy drinks like Monster or Red Bull, but I LOVE this brand! My favorite thing about these energy drinks is that they are nutritionist-friendly. I even sent the nutritional facts to my nutritionist, and she said she’s going to start recommending this drink to other clients who are trying to make healthier choices. The Jaclyn Hill Orange Twist flavor is so refreshing, and the Electric Berry is another favorite of mine. With 150mg of caffeine, it gives me just the right amount of energy without any crash. Other claims: vegan, low calorie, and packed with natural ingredients like green tea caffeine and biotin—such a win! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a healthier energy drink alternative. Read more | 5.0\nThis is literally one of my favorite flavors of all time. The reason I found out about Gorgie is because of this Jaclyn Hill. So this flavor means the world to me. It’s not too sweet it’s the perfect amount of flavor. Before discovering Gorgie, I was cycling through energy drinks like Red Bull, C4, Alani, Monster, and even coffee. Almost all of them gave me anxiety, jitters, and that unpleasant tingling feeling all over my body. The crashes afterward were even worse. That all changed when I found Gorgie. These energy drinks are a total game-changer! They give me a natural, healthy boost of energy that lasts all day, without any anxiety or crashes. Honestly, I’ve never looked back. I’ve completely replaced coffee with Gorgie, and I couldn’t be happier. If you’re on the fence, don’t hesitate—just try it! 100,000/10. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\nI hate coffee, but I need caffeine in the morning; unfortunately, so many energy drinks are terrible for you. I am glad that Gorgie created a healthier alternative. One of the things I love about Gorgie is that they have a reasonable amount of biotin (100% DV). So many drinks or supplements that add biotin put in a ridiculous amount, like 10,000% your daily value, which for me and many others causes acne. Gorgie uses the perfect amount. I haven't really noticed a benefit from the l-theanine, but it is there. As for the flavors, I find the watermelon to be the best by far. I find the tropical punch to not have much flavor, and it is instead tastes more like a vaguely flavored sparkling drink, which isn't bad but also isn't good. The peach flavor is not good in my opinion, but not bad enough where I won't finish it. It has a very weird flavor sadly, which stinks because I love peach. I think it has something to do with its sweetener as it has a slight maple syrup aftertaste. Read more | 4.0\nI have been looking for a healthy energy drink and am thrilled to finally find Gorgie.  I love the taste and the ingredients! No energy crash.  I hope they continue the coupons that make it more affordable. Read more | 5.0\nThese are so refreshing and delicious! Perfect amount of caffeine for a pick me up. I wish they came in a smaller size though. I have a hard time finishing a full one. Read more | 5.0\nOh my gosh. I have found the best Energy Drink out there. You have to try these they are so good. Not overly sweet but sweet enough surprising for not having any sugar. They are so healthy for you. And yes you get the energy. These do so much more for me than coffee. Highly recommend worth every penny. Read more | 5.0\nI wouldn’t buy this variety pack again just because of how awful the peach flavor was. Didn’t taste like peach at all and left a horrible after taste. The other two flavors were pretty good. Read more | 3.0\nDecent taste. But let's face it we drink these for energy and can't expect it to taste amazing. It has the right amount of caffeine to give you just enough boost. A bit pricey which leads to a 1 star off. Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "Green Tea Agave Green Tea These were delicious and energy boosting.  Too expensive for me to use regularly, but I do love them.  I think this is a great product with quality ingredients and it even smells good. Read more | 5.0\nI was pleasantly surprised by how great these made me feel! These tiny little bottles pack a punch! I did notice a cumulative effect, and by day 5, I was really noticing a difference in my energy levels and mental clarity. They are handy to throw in your purse when heading out the door. I do like to drink these straight out of the fridge, but you don't have to keep them refrigerated. I recommend giving them a little shake before you drink because some of the natural ingredients can separate during storage. Overall, highly recommend as a clean energy option without the nasty and unhealthy ingredients, and no energy crash!! Read more | 5.0\nI ordered this product after reading the founder’s story. I related when he said his doctor told him he needed to drink less caffeine for the health of his heart. I had a similar experience working as a night shift ICU nurse during the pandemic. I was tired. Soooo tired. But the extra coffee I was drinking to make it through my long shifts gave me palpitations. I ended up with a heart monitor for a week to make sure my heart was ok. Fortunately, it is! However, my doctor recommended less caffeine.  Much less caffeine. I wish I could have found this product during that time period.  This little drink gave me a noticeable lift in energy with no crash. I avoided energy drinks like this forever because of the taste, but this one actually tastes good! I ordered the Matcha green tea flavor.  It was subtly sweet, as promised, and I actually enjoyed it. I love that the ingredients are all real, and actually improve my health.  You can’t say that about gas station energy drinks. It’s a small little dose, which made it quick to take, and the bottle fit easily into my lunch bag. I love that the benefits compound the longer I take this supplement. Give it a try! Read more | 5.0\nTypically I am a no-frills black coffee person and have been for years. I gave Magic Mind a shot as a supplement to my normal morning coffee routine and was pleasantly surprised. The shot is light and easy and goes best when chilled, shaken, and sipped alongside coffee or other caffeine of choice. An average day at my job requires a fair amount of writing and editing written work, so this supplement worked really effectively for a focused professional setting. I do believe it gave me an extra focus boost, particularly when taken on successive days to give it a chance to build. The ingredients are clean and unique to this supplement blend—the combo of matcha and adaptogens gave me the brain fuel I needed. I have a few suggestions to the brand. First, the price point might be a little high for customers that want to make this a routine habit. Perhaps as the brand grows the cost of production will decrease and the savings can be passed on to the consumer. Second, the flavor was a little heavy on the matcha, especially since it is “ceremonial grade” matcha. I might suggest the brand develops new flavor choices to give consumers a bigger variety and more subtle taste profiles. In the future, I envision an original, a tropical or fruity option, and maybe something akin to a vanilla. Overall, I would recommend this product to students or professionals who spend their time writing, reading, studying, and/or focusing on otherwise cognitively demanding tasks who need an extra boost for productivity and efficiency. Read more | 4.0\nThis product has been amazing for my afternoon slump. Great ingredients, that tase good and help you get through the rest of your day with no jitters. Top quality and delicious.

Easy to drink and I don't have to worry about any nasty ingredients like your typical energy drinks. Read more | 5.0\nVery impressed. I have been taking these for a week and had the most productive week iv had in months. Sustained focus and energy all day, no crash, no brain fog. Read more | 5.0\nJust on my third so I can’t really ascertain if I feel more mentally alert or focused but the drink tastes pretty good and I think I feel a bit of an energy boost. Read more | 3.0\nFocus and productivity have been two big issues for me recently, so I was super excited to try this product! The first time i tried it, it definitely helped me with focus, and i enjoyed the energy boost without the crash or anxiety that i'd usually get from caffeine. It's become a regular part of my routine to drink one of these when I am working, and I overall love the product. The only issue for me, and suggestion i would make to the brand, is about the flavor. There is definitely a distinct taste to the product as well as an aftertaste that typically comes from things that use stevia as a sweetener. I would just suggest maybe adding some vanilla or trying out a different sweetener, because the aftertaste isn't great to me. But other than that, great product! Read more | 4.0",

    "reviews": "This is the basis of my kombucha syrup. I add about a cup and a half of sugar to this bottle to make the reduction. The less sugar I use, the more flavorful because of the combo of the deeply sweet pomegranate with the tart cranberry. Also grape juice is very sweet. On it's own, the juice is not light, and it's not meant to be. Pomegranate is a heavier and sweeter tasting fruit naturally. That's the beauty of adding other juices to cranberry juice. I love this brand and this flavor. It's versatile in my household.

    "reviews": "This is the second flavor of this energy drink by V8 I have tried. I like being healthier, but even the smell of the regular V8 Juice brand makes my tummy turn. But since I love black cherry, and the calorie amount was reasonable, I wanted to try this out. Overall, it is a small but mighty drink that packs in lots of flavor and gives you some extra pizzazz. Did I feel like I could suddenly work 6 more hours because I drank it? No...but I did feel extra pep and mental clarity to keep pushing through about 30 minutes later so that was really appreciated. The drink is quite tasty, extra refreshing if you enjoy it chilled, and I'd suggest putting it in smoothies, too for an extra healthy burst and flavor. The value is right up there for the number of cans you get. I don't give out 5 stars lightly. Read more | 5.0\nI LOOOOOVE the taste of the black cherry, i cant get enough of it.

    "reviews": "I have used this product for a while but this was my first purchase via Amazon. 1 out of 12 cans was slightly dented, nothing significant. I read on reviews about exploding cans? As stated, I have used this product for sometime and never had an exploding can. Unlike other caffeinated energy drinks, this drink does not give me the jitters and really improves my focus and energy yet does not make me crash later. As far as taste, everyone taste things differently. I find too many other energy drinks over the top on sweetness. Bucked up is sweet, but not too strong. Suits my taste. . Read more | 5.0\nThese taste like they're old, or that they've been left in the sun.... You know how synthetic sugar does weird things when heated? Yea that. These don't taste fresh or good like when you buy them at the gas station. And because they were left in the heat somewhere, the flavor is mediocre too.... So don't recommend buying these from Amazon. Read more | 3.0\nI have been purchasing the Cherry Candy flavor for a while now and found the 12 pack on here to save some money per can. A few months ago my order came and it didn't taste right at all. The best way I can compare it to would be the grape flavor they have, so I thought maybe it was a mistake and they put it into the wrong cans. Well the entire box was this nasty flavor and I couldn't drink it. My husband ended up drinking them. I contacted the company to let them know and a lady I spoke to said they changed the formula for it to make it less sweet. Well, they severely messed it up. I don't understand how you could released a product named Cherry Candy when it doesn't taste remotely like cherry. I thought I'd give it one more shot and the next case was even worse. I don't know how it was different again but it was. There was a strange aftertaste and wasn't drinkable. I contacted the email address the lady from the company gave me to request a refund and no one got back to me. It's just really unprofessional to conduct business this way and I won't be purchasing from them ever again. This was a very disappointing experience for me. It's hard for me to find flavors that aren't gross and this one had become my favorite. If the company sees this PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!!

Potent Energy Boost: Each serving of Bucked Up Energy Drink contains 300mg of energy-enhancing ingredients, providing a powerful and sustained boost to alertness and vitality. 2. Delicious Flavor: The Cherry Hard Candy flavor offers a delightful taste experience, combining the sweetness of cherry with hints of nostalgic hard candy, making it enjoyable to consume. 3. Convenient Packaging: Available in a pack of 12, these drinks are conveniently packaged for on-the-go consumption, making them ideal for active lifestyles, workouts, or busy days. 4.

Zero Sugar: With no added sugars, the Bucked Up Energy Drink provides a guilt-free energy boost, making it suitable for individuals watching their sugar intake or following a low-carb lifestyle. Cons: 1. High Caffeine Content: The 300mg caffeine content per serving may be too potent for some individuals, potentially leading to jitteriness or difficulty sleeping if consumed in excess. 2. Artificial Ingredients: While delicious, the Cherry Hard Candy flavor may contain artificial flavors or sweeteners, which may not be suitable for those seeking all-natural or organic options. 3. Individual Sensitivity: Some users may experience sensitivity to certain ingredients in the drink, such as caffeine or taurine, leading to adverse reactions or discomfort. 4. Limited Availability: Depending on location, the Bucked Up Energy Drink may not be readily accessible in all markets, making it challenging for some consumers to purchase. Overall, the Bucked Up Energy Drink in Cherry Hard Candy flavor offers a potent and delicious solution for individuals seeking a convenient and effective energy boost.

    "reviews": "I often purchase these since they taste great and feel that they are healthier than carbonated caffeine drinks. They take a while to expire so I am not racing to finish them. Best price I have found for these! Read more | 5.0\nLove these ready made energy drinks. They do not have carbonation which is perfect for me. It is difficult to find energy drinks without the carbonation. They have an average amount of caffeine content compared to other drinks. I wish the bottle was easier to open- I recently switched to the fast twitch single powders because of this. I had too hard of time opening the bottle, and it could just be me.

    "reviews": "Wild Orchard White Gummy Deer Sour Bucks Pink Lemonade Breezy Blast Blue Raz Blood Raz I wish these were sold at gas stations near me! Back when I was in Germany with the US Army, I always grabbed them at the shoppette. After trying them, I never went back to Monster or Red Bull. They taste amazing and deliver exactly what you need. These got me through countless 24-hour CQ shifts and long workdays, so I know they’re perfect for anyone with a demanding, hard-working job who needs a reliable pick-me-up. Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nSuch a great flavor! Read more | 5.0\nThis Bucked Up Energy Drink doesn’t just wake you up—it launches you into another dimension where productivity is limitless, and bad decisions seem like great ideas. 300mg of caffeine? Oh yeah, that’s the secret sauce that turns \"just five more minutes\" into \"I deep-cleaned the entire house, reorganized my emails, and might run a marathon.\" Flavor? Solid. Jitters? Surprisingly minimal (unless you chug it, which, let’s be honest, I did). If you need a boost that doesn’t mess around, this is the one. Just don’t drink it at night unless you enjoy staring at the ceiling, contemplating life choices at 2 AM. Read more | 5.0\nIt saddens me to have to leave this type of review because it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the product itself. As someone who works out a lot and can take a significant amount of caffeine at once, I absolutely adore Bucked Up energy drinks. I purchased one in the local store just to try it because I was just making the move from 250mg to 300mg, so I wanted to go very slowly until I was sure my body would handle it well. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the drinks and have been hooked ever since. HOWEVER, Amazon should be ashamed of themselves how poorly this was packaged and shipped. My cans were loose and all over the place. The box was coming apart. They weren't in their case, they were thrown all over the box. I know one burst and most of the product was gone. I didn't even get to drink that one, so I just popped the top and poured the remaining out. Several of the cans were all dented up. What is this? I spent $30 on 12 cans of energy drinks, then I expect 12 cans of energy drinks. I can't send this back. At least not all of it since I had to throw one away, but I suspect they know this, so they don't care. I have definitely been cheated with these. I don't know who needs to fix this in their shipping/handling department, but something has got to give. I am a loyal buyer when I find something I like. Please don't make me look for this product elsewhere. This was not a good look at all. I am so disappointed, which is unfortunate because I actually like the product. All I can do is shake my head. Get it together!!!! Read more | 1.0\nGood taste and caffeine content only downside is it spills over when you open it. Could be overfilled or too much carbonation. It’ll wake you up though. Read more | 4.0\nFirst off, I haven't had a bad tasting Bucked Up.  Haven't had them all, but the ones I have had (Miami, Rocket Pop, Blue Raz and White Gummy) are all really good.  Hard to pick a favorite, tastes change week to week. My only issue is a personal one, caffeine does nothing for me!  I drink one of these almost every morning and I'm still doing the head bobble thing at my desk.  Might be in part to the mind numbing job I have, but that's another review!  Cheers Read more | 5.0\nGreat product and perfect shipping time Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor isn't so bad although several cans of mine fizzed up by themselves even though they weren't shaken so definitely be ready to sip unless you're okay with a mess. It has a softer cherry flavor but it's slightly there & it's alright it just gets annoying how many cans fizz up. Might consider getting more but if the fizz problem occurs again I'll most likely stop. Read more | 3.0",

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating.

    "reviews": "Blueberry White Tea Tropical Tea Sweet Tea Raspberry Tea Mango Half & Half Lemon Tea Green Tea Diet Green Tea Diet Arnold Palmer Arnold Palmer Rx Energy If you’re looking for a refreshing beverage that’s light on calories but still packs a punch in flavor, AriZona Diet Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey is a solid choice. Packed in a convenient 22oz can, this tea offers the perfect balance of sweet, earthy green tea and the natural sweetness of honey. Plus, with the addition of ginseng, you get that extra bit of energy to keep you going without the sugar overload. If you’re a fan of iced tea but want to cut down on calories, this one’s for you! Pros: 1. Great Taste: The combination of green tea, honey, and ginseng creates a flavorful, smooth taste that’s not too sweet, making it enjoyable for a wide range of palates. 2. Low-Calorie: With only a few calories per serving, this drink is perfect for those who want to indulge in a refreshing beverage without feeling guilty. 3. Convenient Packaging: The 22oz can is large enough to quench your thirst but still portable. It’s the perfect size to throw in your bag for a quick refreshment during the day. 4. Natural Sweetness: The honey provides a natural sweetness without the artificial aftertaste that some sugar substitutes can leave behind. It’s a nice touch for those who prefer more natural ingredients. 5. Energy Boost: The inclusion of ginseng gives you a light energy boost without the jitters or crash you might get from traditional energy drinks or sodas. Cons: 1. Not for Those Who Prefer Strong Green Tea Flavor: While it’s a smooth, balanced flavor, some might find the green tea taste a bit mild and overshadowed by the honey and ginseng. If you’re a fan of a strong, bold green tea flavor, this might not hit the spot. 2. Could Use More Ginseng: Although ginseng is included, the effects might be subtle for those looking for a more noticeable energy boost. You may not feel much of a difference if you’re used to more potent energy supplements. 3. Artificial Sweeteners: Even though the product claims natural ingredients, some may notice a slight artificial taste due to the inclusion of artificial sweeteners in the mix. 4. Caffeine Sensitivity: The tea contains caffeine, so if you’re sensitive to it, you may want to watch how much you drink, especially late in the day to avoid disrupting your sleep. All in all, AriZona Diet Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey is a refreshing, low-calorie option that’s both tasty and energizing. It’s perfect for anyone looking to cut back on sugary sodas while still enjoying a flavorful beverage. Just be mindful of the sweetness and caffeine if you’re sensitive to those factors.

    "reviews": "ZERO Variety Pack Variety Pack Punch Variety Pack ZERO Wild Ruby Red ZERO Wild Ice Pop ZERO Wild Berry Yerba Mate Tropical Punch Peach Mango Original Lite Fruit Punch ZERO Wild Strawberry Watermelon Love these flavors! Caffeine content just right for me. I only drink half a can a day and it supplies enough energy to get me going on days I don’t have time to make coffee Read more | 5.0\nTastes good, quality ingredients and kept me awake to finish term papers overnight. Read more | 5.0\nIf you're anything like me, you have a busy life, and getting 8+ hours of sleep every night just doesn't happen. You need something to get through your day, and the proliferation of mass-market energy drinks has led you to chugging one, two, three or even more in a day! Not good! I know my own Bed Rull (clever!) drinking was getting out-of-control, and it was having a serious impact on both my health and my wallet. In my desperation for a source of healthier, more cost and eco friendly energy, I turned to my local natural grocery store and found this: GURU Lite. Made with Stevia instead of all those \"let's all wait for the news story about the horrible health impacts\" artificial sweeteners, and containing only ingredients you can actually pronounce (sparking water, lemon juice, cane juice, guarana seed, luo han gua juice, steevia, echinacea, ginko, ginseng)it sounded pretty promising. But what about the energy? Well it works, I took my first sip, went \"oh well, crap, doesn't work\" and then 2 minutes later I was awake! No jitters, no \"surge-o-epic caffeine\" - just awake. It's refreshing, if you're used to the \"wired wired wired wired zing zoom bzzzzz crash!\" of normal energy drinks, get ready for one that actually just makes you feel like yourself. Not wired, not tired, not cranky, not crazy, just a couple extra hours of focus as YOU! But what about the flavor? GURU Lite is best described as \"not bad\", I like it room temperature, you may prefer it chilled. Unlike those commercial heart-attacks-in-a-can, GURU focused on health over sugar-load, so expect a slightly lemony, earthy herbal taste. It is not by an means bad tasting, but it's not like liquid candy, it's a simple, natural flavor that doesn't overwhelm or make you want to chug twenty of them. You drink this for the health and energy, and the taste is secondary. I don't want you to think \"oh it tastes bad...\" because it doesn't, it's just the taste is definitely not the focus, it's not a soda, it's more like a glass of water - you drink it because you're thirsty, and this, you drink because you are tired and want to be awake. What about the cost? Well, Amazon has the best deal around. I chose the subscribe-and-save option and came home to find a box, wrapped in a clear plastic wrap to protect against rain, two days later. Inside was my case of GURU (which looks exactly like the picture). I found with GURU not only am I drinking fewer of them than I did with Bed Rull, but I'm able to sleep better and of course I'm ending each month with tons of cash in my pocket that is no longer being spent on over-priced, junk-laden commercial \"energy\". And the best part? I have all the energy I want at hand in a far, far healthier package. Give it a shot today, you will be pleasantly surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI don’t typically like sparkling drinks. They are hard to drink. They tend to make me feel bloated, and usually they taste terrible because they’re meant to be on the lighter side, calorie wise. For example, Celsius sparkling drinks. I LOVE the non carbonates drinks they make! But the sparkling/carbonation side of them make them hard to enjoy, and the taste is not as good as their non carbonated drinks. If you’ve tried them, you know what I mean. These drinks are also sparkling, but somehow they aren’t as “carbonated” feeling and tasting! Impressive! They have a perfect balance for that effect. Makes it easier to chug when I’m in a hurry. Was also worried about the taste! I’ve never tasted Yerba mate, so I was expecting a very strong earthy taste. It mostly taste like a delicate mint taste with a mild “artificial” sweetening aftertaste and a hint of tea. Seriously impressed. Usually when you see all these healthier ingredients you know it’s good for you, or better for you anyways, but you know it’s probably not going to taste very good. One example of a “lighter” drink such as this one, or similar anyways as far as the use of “better ingredients” in the product, is the jocko willink energy drink. In the ingredients list, you will see things that will make you feel better about drinking the product. But it doesn’t taste good at all. This drink has great ingredients and balanced use of them to give it just enough taste and carbonation, to enjoy. I’m amazed with this product and will buy two more of these cases. I regret not getting the variety packs at sams when they did carry them, because I want to try the other flavors. Give these a shot if you so t mins a light tasting, light carbonation effect energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI wasted $50.00 on an unsuspecting change in recipe that showed up at my door.  The GURU original use to be AMAZING, now it takes like overly sweet artificial crap.  There was no warning on this change, so BEWARE.  If you like the beverage in the can without the \"Good Energy Original\" writing at the bottom of the can, this is no longer in existence.  Amazon will not give you a refund for this change either unless the product is damaged... Read more | 1.0\n10/10 flavor and ingredients. These are my go-to energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nI've tried them all and this is my favorite energy drink by far. Very clean organic ingredients, including the caffeine sources. No jitters, just gooood energy!

One sip, and suddenly, I’m organizing my entire garage, signing up for a 5K, and considering learning Mandarin. Now, let’s talk about the real magic here: the energy boost. Halfway through my second can, I could see sounds and hear colors. By the third, I was typing at 300 words per minute, and by the fourth… well, I think I briefly phased into another dimension.

This stuff made me give up Monster permanently. Read more | 5.0\nI am a trucker who likes to have a little caffeine sipping drink in one cup holder and my water in the other, and sugar free Red Bull is the perfect size and caffeine amount! I can sip on it for a few hours without getting the jitters, yet it is still small enough that I can finish it before it goes flat. I do not feel like I get an energy crash when the caffeine wears off, which is extremely important for someone who drives a 40-ton vehicle. It just helps wake me up faster in the morning because I don’t have a coffee maker in my rig and don’t always want to have to walk all the way into the truck stop for a coffee, so I keep some in my truck fridge. I am also a student and have cracked open a Red Bull at the end of my work day to get some school work done, and it gives me the energy pick me up that I need, but I can still fall asleep after, so I’m not too wired from it! Out of dozens and dozens of orders, have received a few packs that were dented up, and only once did I receive an order so badly banged up that a few leaked, but it seemed to be more of a delivery issue from the weight of them, but Amazon made it right!!! I also had a malfunction in my truck fridge and the entire fridge froze, and only one of the Red Bull cans leaked, but the others were just expanded and I really appreciated only having to clean up one Red Bull slushy, so keep making those cans as sturdy as you have been!!!

I’m just happy Amazon got it in stock and I can continue my subscribe and save and get my orders on a regular basis. Read more | 5.0\nRed Bull Total Zero is an excellent choice for those who want the energy boost of a traditional Red Bull without the sugar and calories. The flavor is quite similar to the original Red Bull, with a slightly less sweet taste, which I find refreshing. It provides the same energy-boosting effects, thanks to its blend of caffeine, taurine, and B vitamins, making it perfect for a quick pick-me-up or pre-workout drink. I appreciate that it offers the same performance enhancement without the added sugar, making it a guilt-free option.

The flavor is like a fruity, sparkling party in a can—perfectly sweet with no sugar and no weird aftertaste. It’s hard to describe the flavor exactly, but it feels like a mix of berry and grape with a fun, cosmic twist. What’s even better is that it gives me the energy I need without the crash. I drink it in the afternoon for a pick-me-up, and it keeps me going through work or a workout. The fact that it’s sugar-free makes it guilt-free too! The packaging is super cute and eye-catching, and the carbonation level is just right—not too fizzy, not flat. I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious and refreshing energy drink. This one is my absolute favorite flavor from Alani Nu, and I can’t wait to keep stocking up! Read more | 5.0\nI recently started using Alani Nutrition products, and I am so impressed! The Alani Energy Drinks are my new go-to for a quick pick-me-up. They taste amazing (I’m obsessed with the Watermelon flavor!), and they give me a clean, sustained energy boost without any jitters or crashes. I’ve also tried the Alani Pre-Workout, and it delivers on all fronts—great taste, increased energy, and enhanced focus during my workouts. I love how it’s packed with ingredients that actually make a difference in my performance, plus it doesn’t upset my stomach like some other pre-workouts do. What I really appreciate is how Alani uses high-quality, transparent ingredients with no artificial junk. Plus, their products are all about supporting a healthy lifestyle, which resonates with me. If you're looking for a delicious, effective, and clean energy boost or supplement, I highly recommend giving Alani Nutrition a try. I can’t wait to try more products from them!

    "reviews": "Had a hard time securing the large amounts of Bang we wanted for a daily habit. Little leery of ordering any food products online, but they seem good. Honestly the only sugar free energy drink we can tolerate, much better cold, but I REALLY need a large dose of caffeine and I need to drop the sugar. We like a variety of flavors, but find some of them they can make our stomachs hurt if we drink them daily, our go to is peach mango (which is NOT what I would have guessed for me, lol), but we like the strawberry, blue raspberry, cotton candy, birthday cake the best, and the purple haze isn't bad, the sour flavors....forget it, lol, my old stomach can't. Bang honestly is the best energy drink I have tried. It doesn't usually give me the jitters, it doesn't usually make me crash (unless I drink the whole thing really fast for some reason or I am having a particularly bad day), it tastes MILES better than anything else sugar free....all the orders have arrived in tact, and I don't have to worry about having to track down an energy drink from every grocery store/gas station like some sort of crazy person...I ain't got the time...I just need large quantities of caffeine to function because of health problems, lol. Read more | 5.0\nMy favorite flavor of bang and I always grab a case when it goes on sale! These are no joke though and have 300mg of caffeine!

Read more | 5.0\nIn my opinion of the variety of flavors offered by bang, this is the best one. Tastes like a purple skittle. It boosts my energy level and focus with out the jitters.

It’s a pretty good flavor, for it being one of the few Flavors that doesn’t have artificial coloring which is a big plus as well. Make sure to shake well always before each sip so you can get the full experience and mixture because it will all start to fall to the bottom over a few minutes. Definitely recommend if you want that extra little boost of energy and focus in your day or to wake you up in the mornings. Recommend not to drink it too late at night so you’re not wired before bed, but everyone is different! Quality is definitely there! The taste strength is a little less than other flavors but after a few times you will start to enjoy it.

I mean, who would have thought that a video game-inspired energy drink would actually taste good? But let me tell you, this stuff is legit. First of all, let's talk about the packaging. As a huge fan of the Fallout franchise, I was already sold on the Nuka Cola Quantum theme. The bright blue color and retro design really stand out on my kitchen counter, and it's always a conversation starter when friends come over. But let's get down to the important stuff – the taste. I love the sugar-free energy powder, and i was pleasantly surprised. The Nuka Cola Quantum flavor is like a mix of fruity goodness with a hint of citrus, and it's not too sweet or artificial tasting. It's like a party in your mouth every time you take a sip. And the energy boost? Oh boy, let me tell you – this stuff works. I usually mix up a drink in the morning before work, and I don't even need my usual cup of coffee anymore. The energy lasts for hours without any jitters or crash, which is a huge plus in my book. But here's the best part – the Nuka Cola Quantum Energy Powder is actually good for you. With vitamins, antioxidants, and no artificial colors or flavors, I feel good about fueling my day with this stuff. Plus, it's so much cheaper and more convenient than grabbing a sugary energy drink from the store. Overall, I have to give the G Fuel Nuka Cola Quantum Energy Powder a solid 5 stars. It's tasty, effective, and just plain fun to drink. So if you're a gamer, an energy drink enthusiast, or just looking for a little pick-me-up during the day, give this stuff a try. You won't be disappointed. Read more | 5.0\nI got this particular flavor because it was discounted. I actually assumed at first that it was gonna be cola flavored. Surprisingly, it has a tropical, fruity flavor. I don't really know what to compare it to and I don't have a super sophisticated pallet, but I think I tasted coconut and maybe some pineapple. Basically it's like a fruit punch with some combination of your typical tropical fruits. While not one of my absolute favorite Gfuel flavors, it definitely falls in the enjoyable category. Read more | 5.0\nThis is a weird one, you will either love or hate it. I love coconut, but when I tasted this, a medicinal flavor seemed prominent. Then I realized that the medicine flavor was actually a slight cola, not mixing well with the tropical stuff. Now that my brain can process the flavors, I love this… but it takes some getting used to. It’s also a very strong flavor, so if you prefer lighter flavors, don’t bother with Nuka Cola Quantum.

    "reviews": "Tasty, cost-effective, cleanish energy & vitamins. I sometimes mix with unflavored collagen peptides and it blends well. Hubs likes to use partial packets in 16oz water to make them last longer. I like that it's not so much caffeine that I crash. The flavors are decent, a little vitaminy, but I expected that. We are repeat buyers and will continue unless they change the price or use lower quality ingredients. I also like that it doesn't have sucralose and isn't in a chunky plastic container like another brand. Read more | 5.0\nI love the pureboost hydration and energy packets. I love the flavors so much and it’s a plus that it is all natural. It gives me sustained energy without a crash while also hydrating with me. I really like to have these before and during the gym! Read more | 5.0\nHighly recommend for a gym pre-workout for anyone looking for no jitters, no itch, just energy. Also good throughout the day as a pick me up! I love the taste, it's tart and and doesn't taste like artificial sweeteners which are an automatic no for my taste buds. It's clean energy, no jitters, no buzzing, no crash and I use it to boost me up for the gym, especially on 4:30 am days. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 just because when used on an empty stomach it can cause some upset for some people (just like any B vitamin complex, green tea can also have the same effect!) I like to go to the gym on an empty stomach and learned if I only used half a packet it didn't affect me at all and I still got a great boost, so there's definitely a work around and the product works so well it's worth it! (Plus only using 1/2 or 3/4 of a packet at a time saved me some money in the long run, so win-win) Now that I started intermittent fasting, this will break your fast because it has 25 calories and also 2 grams of carbs so if you're doing keto or fasting it's something to be aware of to fit it into your day properly. All in all fantastic product that I've been using for years Read more | 4.0\nI love that this product uses methylcobalamin for the B12 that’s the whole reason I bought it. I wish the other products offered by this company did as well. The taste is very reminiscent of a sweettart it was a bit string at the first sip but not something I couldn’t adjust to. The fizz does need to be watched out for (as the box says) I accidentally created a gushing geyser in my thermos more than once All in all a very good product Have already purchased in a larger quantity for daily use Read more | 5.0\nI love the taste and ease of drinking the Pureboost mixes. It has made my water intake increase by at least double. I bought the combo pack to see what flavor I liked best, but I love them all!  It helps me to want to drink more water. Having no sugar and no crash is good for me to be able to drink these all day long. Read more | 5.0\nI recently cut out sucralose and I have had a hard time finding a solid energy drink replacement. These come in convenient packets, have a healthy amount of clean caffeine at 100mg (so I can have more than one a day if I wish), and it has a bunch of other ingredients for health benefits! I have replaced morning coffee with this and I actually gave some to my wife as she was recently sick and she said it helped her feel much better. She’s also very picky with flavor but enjoyed açaí flavor! 100% would recommend this to any of my friends looking to replace sucralose ridden energy drinks with a clean alternative. Read more | 5.0\nLove the drink and have been drinking it for while now but it has too high of a percentage of b vitamins. My bloodwork was crazy off from drinking it daily. I had to stop drinking it to make sure it was the cause and it was.  I also only like the citrus flavor. The others taste like chalky medicine. But I love the clean energy the drink provides. Read more | 4.0\nI can't use any fake sugar, hate coffee and resorted to soda in the morning for my \"boost\". I tried Pure Boost and I was so impressed with the flavor and how I felt after drinking it! I had energy and felt...alive, not sure how else to explain it. I LOVE the Acai Berry most but all flavors are excellent and that little fizz helps with my carbonation fix. ;)  I am forever a customer! Thank you for this! Read more | 5.0",

Here’s why: What I Love: 🌟 Unique Flavor: The strawberry and apricot blend is delicious and refreshing! It’s fruity and sweet but not overly sugary – a perfect balance. I find it way more enjoyable than regular Red Bull flavors. 🌟 Energizing Kick: With 80mg of caffeine, I get a nice, steady boost without feeling jittery or over-caffeinated. It’s the perfect pick-me-up for those long workdays or before a workout. 🌟 Taurine & B Vitamins: The added taurine and B vitamins provide an extra energy boost and help keep me focused. I feel more alert and productive after having one of these! 🌟 Convenient Pack: The pack of 24 cans is great for stocking up, and I love having them on hand for when I need a quick energy boost. The cans are perfectly sized at 8.4 fl oz, making them easy to carry around in my bag or keep in my fridge. 🌟 No Crash: I’ve noticed that after drinking the Red Bull Amber Edition, I don’t experience the usual energy crash that some energy drinks give me. The boost feels more balanced, and I stay energized for hours. Why It’s Worth It: The Red Bull Amber Edition has quickly become my go-to energy drink because it combines great taste with reliable energy. I love the strawberry apricot flavor, and it gives me just the right amount of energy to power through my day without any crashes. ⭐ Rating: 5/5 If you're looking for a tasty and effective energy drink that’s both flavorful and energizing, the Red Bull Amber Edition Strawberry Apricot is a must-try.

Whether powering through deadlines at work or staying energized during workouts, Monster Energy Zero Ultra consistently delivers reliable performance and stamina support.

Read more | 5.0\nI have been ordering Monster off Amazon for a couple of years now. Amazon is by far the best price and the only place I can purchase a 15 pack of Monster. I have gotten Monster for under 2.00 a can by purchasing the sugar free flavors that are under $30. All of the flavors are decent, I’d have to say I lean more towards the berry flavors with Strawberry dreams being my favorite. But all Monster’s  have a crisp refreshing taste to them. The biggest and only problem I run into with purchasing Monster through Amazon is, the package have been damaged in the past. Very few cans have been dented. I have only had 3 cans ever be delivered that were not full and that was not Amazons fault it was a manufacturing error. These can’s were not dented, no holes were in these can’s, the top’s had not be opened at all. They were simply not filled correctly through the Monster warehouse. I never contacted Amazon about the 3 particular damaged cans or any of the damaged boxes. I did try to reach out to Monster and it was far too complicated to do so. They only allow you to contact them via their page that has particular options on how, what and where you purchased your Monster product.  purchasing a 15 pack of Monster through Amazon are not options. I also struggled with seeing  some of the information Monster requires off the can that is damaged. All in all I would recommend to anyone who drinks Monster on a regular basis for their daily boost of energy to purchase through Amazon. Read more | 5.0\nI purchased the Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango Sugar Free for my son, who needs a boost of energy but can't have the sugar. This drink is exactly what we were looking for! The flavor is delicious and refreshing, with a nice tropical mango taste that isn't too overpowering. It's sweetened just enough to make it enjoyable, but without any of the sugar that would normally be a concern. The energy boost is noticeable, and it helps my son stay focused and alert without any jitters or crashes, which can sometimes happen with other energy drinks. Plus, it's a great option for anyone looking to avoid sugar but still need that pick-me-up. Overall, I highly recommend Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango for anyone who needs an energy boost but wants to keep things sugar-free. It’s a win-win! Read more | 5.0\nI have tried EVERY flavor of Monster Zero Ultra and overall, love this product, love the taste, and love that it's sugar-free and only 10 calories THAT BEING SAID, not every flavor is created equal. The BEST flavors of Monster Ultra are... -Paradise (green can, tastes like green Jolly Ranchers) -Sunrise (orange, tastes like Sunny D but carboated) -Watermelon -Peachy Keen (this one is so friggin good, it's crazy how good it is) The WORST flavors are... -Fiesta Mango! Stay away from this one! It tastes so bad, it tastes like how a hair salon smells when someone gets their hair permed! -Red (It's just not very good, just has a very vague flavor). -Black (Also just not very good, tastes like cough medicine) But for real though, do NOT get the Fiesta Mango.

It does not have the crash effect of some of the other drinks I have tried.  No jitters, no headache just plenty of focus to get you moving or keep you moving. I put mine in the fridge just so they are not room temp. Love this product, am a fan and will keep buying. Read more | 5.0\nThese Extra Strength Energy Shots in Blue Raspberry flavor deliver a strong, fast, and reliable energy boost. I mainly use them when I don’t have time for coffee or to power through 12-hour delivery shifts during the Christmas season. They work great, and I take them straight up instead of mixing them into anything. Pros: ✅ Quick & Effective Energy—Kicks in fast and lasts. ✅ Convenient & Portable—Perfect for busy days. ✅ Sugar-Free—No crash. ✅ I Actually Like the Flavor!—But it’s not for everyone. Cons: ❌ Not a True 2oz Shot—Packets range between 1.5–1.8oz since the packaging itself weighs 0.2oz, and brings into question the accuracy of the nutrition facts. ❌ Looks Like Pee When Mixed in Water—If you try to dilute it, be warned! It’s not the most appetizing color. Caution (Not a Con!): ⚠️ Respect the Two-A-Day Limit! I had a second one six hours after the first, and I definitely understand why they warn against exceeding two. Final Thoughts: If you need a strong energy boost, these work great. Just don’t expect a full 2oz, and if you mix it with water, brace yourself for an unfortunate color. 😂⚡🔥 Read more | 4.0\nI bought them for the caffeine vs buying energy drinks. They are much better priced and I dont have to drink all that extra stuff with them. Mystic melon is pretty good, but the other one that has a red label has a funky taste to it. Read more | 5.0\nLooking for Gu replacement, this was a fluid with bad taste, recommend just sticking with brand name Gu or Cliff Blocks (better nutrients and lower caffeine content) Read more | 1.0\nI've tried all kinds of caffeine/energy drinks, and this is actually the only one that has any effect on me. I like the fact that it's flat and portable. I just tear each side toward the middle and it opens easily. I drink half at a time, because however they ration out and combine the ingredients actually has an impact on me. It's a nice change, and somehow I've been sleeping deeper at night. Not sure if that has anything to do with anything, or just that I'm off of work for these two days 😂 But I love these and will definitely be ordering more. Flavors are not bad, I've tried grape and the melon ones so far. Read more | 5.0\nFirst one I tried was the melon. It was just liquid with an unnatural melon taste. I am planning on putting the gels in my water/isotonic drink. I did keep my energy levels up so they do seem to do the job. Read more | 3.0\nThere is 250mg of caffein and taurine in this. I bought this product for a few reasons. 1. I am on a keto diet, and this does not send me out of ketosis but does provide energy. 2. I am used to using pre- work out from power lifting, but currently I am training for my first sprint triathlon. This product does not give you a sugar rush, note that I have adjusted my daily caffein intake to take this supplement while training. (this is closer to a mild pre-workout, with a shorter bust of energy and less whip lash) Effect- 6.5/10 for energy boost (on keto) Muscle aches in mid exercise went away, and I felt energized within 10 minutes of drinking this and the effects lasted 40 minutes. I was expecting this to last closer to 60 or 90 minutes and potentially making me have diarrhea because of the 250mg of caffein but that was not the case. 2 hours later and no indigestion or diarrhea. The come down is not steep or depleting, instead its linear and easy. all in all 8/10, I would just like the boost to last a little longer and I personally did not feel the taurine or get any tingling in my face. Taste? yah its okay, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting after reading the other reviews. Its a pre-work out in a tube, and I have tasted a lot worse pre work outs. But its definitely not a sweet get/ syrup. Read more | 5.0\nThe media could not be loaded. Update II: There doesn't seem to be any consistency, yet the price increased by almost 50%. They are supposed to be 2oz shots. They range from 1.8 to 2oz shots with the packaging. The packaging is .2oz, so you're really getting 1.6 to 1.8oz.  Ill just go back to 5hr Energy. I know what Im getting, and it's consistent. UPDATE: Its been about a week. The best thing to compare these to are Dollar Store XTreme Energy Shots, but with better flavor. They're ok, but they're no 5-Hour Energy.  For the current price, I'll keep using them. No jitters, and no crash. Up to 4 stars. I'm going to start this at 2 stars, because literally nobody paid for it - everyone received it for free. I paid for it. It gets 1 star because it showed up, and it's budget friendly. It gets a second star, because so far, the Melon one tastes pretty good. It doesn't have that sour afterbite of a 5 hour Energy. I WILL update this post within a few days, after I've had a chance to use the product. Read more | 2.0",

    "reviews": "The weight watchers chocolate shakes taste is very good. Satisfying. Price was less than I can buy at the grocery store. Easy to grab and go. I haven’t purchased them in the past few months because I found a different brand with higher protein. Which is a priority for me. Read more | 5.0\nI love these.  I’m not always hungry for a meal. It does make you feel full for at least four hours.  Adkins and Premiere taste great but I don’t feel full after drinking them.  I love the taste.  I needed something low carb and some protein. It is convenient too. Read more | 5.0\nThis is my personal experience/opinion, but I truly believe this product helped alleviate my hunger and helped me heal faster. It also came in handy when I had to take my antibiotics. More specifically, when I took my antibiotics on a empty stomach, I was having this bizarre stomach pain; but with this slim fast drink, I didn't feel anything. The taste of this drink is what I expected. Since it has a lot of vitamins and protein, I expected the flavor to be slightly unpleasant and the texture to be a little thick; and I was right. It also has a strong artificial vanilla flavor with artificial sweetener. Overall, the flavor isn't the greatest but it's not bad to the point where I couldn't drink it. In fact, after my 2nd slim fast, I got use to the flavor and started to enjoy it. I'm more grateful that I actually felt satisfied both physically and mentally. I also noticed that the majority of negative reviews are due to expired products. Luckily for me, I didn't have that issue. To end this, if you have any type of oral surgery coming up that will require you to be on a liquid diet, try this first and see if you like it BEFORE YOUR SURGERY. Of course, see if you can get your hand on a single slim fast before you buy this bulk lol Thanks Amazon and Slim Fast 💙 Read more | 5.0\nThey taste great and curve my hunger during the day. I just wish they were a bit larger. Can finish one in no time at all. Read more | 4.0\n5/26/2023: I'm starting a new diet and weight loss plan using Slimfast, healthier meals, and by staying active for at least 30 minutes a day. My starting weight is 185 and I am 5'5\" tall. The goal is to lose 40 pounds. After getting the approval from my doctor, I bought the energy Mocha Cappuccino Slimfast shakes for energy in the morning and I bought regular Slimfast shakes to drink midday. It states on the bottle that in order to lose weight, you can have one meal a day (having at least 1,200 calories a day in total), replace two meals with either shakes smoothies or bars, and you can have up to three snacks. I find this pretty sensible. The shake itself is delicious. There is no chalky taste, either. The cappuccino taste isn't too strong but it's still good. The consistency is thin, not thick like a shake normally would be but this doesn't bother me. I'd say it works so far. I woke up after having a rough nights sleep and this shake gave me the energy boost I needed to start the day and I'm also full as well. We'll see how long the full feeling lasts. If you are trying to lose weight this way, go in to it with the right expectations. I don't think the shake alone is meant to keep you full for hours. It does HELP to keep you full, but you still have to have snacks in between and a decent meal. Will update the review in the future to give results. Good luck to anyone else trying to lose weight! We got this! Read more | 5.0\nThis is now my favorite protein drink!! Flavorful,  no chalky after taste, not super thick, and just the perfect amount for a breakfast or lunch replacement.  Keeps me satisfied and full. Not to mention a great price too!! Read more | 5.0\nThis has helped with my cravings for something sweet and it keeps me full for hours! I used this for a month and was able to lose a little over 10lbs. This is a great food replacement if you are in a hurry or just one something simple and fast. I drank one for breakfast and lunch, then when it comes to dinner I eat something that's not the shake. Read more | 5.0\nChocolate tastes almost like the vanilla. It's drinkable , not super sweet or super chocolatey and filling. However it as a somewhat chalky taste. Protien count and ease of use are what make it 4 stars. More flavor and it would be a 5.

The kicks in relatively quick too, so it's after about 20 - 30 minutes of drinking this expect to start to feel sleepy. At least that's how it works for me. You literally don't have to do anything different with things that you would any other more enhancer. Just put it in a coffee cup full of water, or half a bottle of water, shake it up and drink it. That's it. Also, it tastes delicious. And I don't mean it tastes good for a. supplement kind of good. Let's drink actually really taste delicious in its own right. I often put them in my evening smoothie. If I don't have my smoothie in the morning with my vitamins and stuff in it, I have a tropical smoothie with bananas, pineapples and often mangoes in it in the evening. So this is a great addition to those as well. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using this product for months. I love the convenient packets. Easy to travel with. The taste is great and I get a good night sleep every night without waking up drowsy in the morning. Read more | 5.0\nI have half a packet on work nights and I don't wake up in the middle of the night nearly as often. It's expensive but worth it. Read more | 5.0\nMy son has used these for several years to help him sleep when he is stressed from school or when his sleep patterns shift due to late study nights/exams.  He will drink 1/2 a bottle before he is ready to head to bed.  We now send them to college for him as no other alternative option seems to work.  He says they don't necessarily make him groggy or overly tired, they just help his brain and body quiet down and settle into a state conducive for sleep.  I have tasted them, and they taste great and are just lightly carbonated.  At times they are hard to find -- I hope they stay on the market as nothing he tries in place of these work as well for him. Read more | 5.0\nThis stuff clearly means everything it says. It definitely has the correct ingredients! I mean within about 30 mins you'll be yawning. It leads to a deep sleep as well and I've been waking up feeling well rested. My only complaint actually is the fact that I did an additional order and the shipper delayed the order for 30 days. Seems like an inventory issue which is very unfortunate Read more | 4.0\nThey give you the perfect amount of energy they truly work I’ve been hooked for 4 yrs sad I can only get them here now. Read more | 5.0\nI used to take this back in the day. It was awesome. I'd literally take it every morning before the chemistry class after not sleeping more than 4 hours the night before, and I'd sit through lectures still half asleep and yet absorb everything. The rush from the caffeine didn't make my body jittery and instead all of that energy went to my head. Unfortunately, things have changed since then. I think this product line went from being called NeuroGasm, to NeuroSupreme, to NeuroPassion, and back to NeuroGasm again. They had the same disappointing description of \"proprietary blend\" (to protect their formula from those that may intend to steal it, but that left consumers wondering of what they bought and whether or not they got their money's worth) as they do now, but they'd have the total weight of the blend listed. Now they only list the dose of the caffeine (100mg) for the product like they do with their NeuroSonic line which also is terrible. Originally, NeuroGasm (or Neuro Passion, also Neuro Supreme) and NeuroSonic used to almost have all the same ingredients, but NeuroGasm just had more as proved by the total weights of the proprietary blends. So NeuroGasm was just a way better product for mental performance (for the same price too) than NeuroSonic. Now they are both terrible. While the full proprietary blend is no longer listed, since they do have the 100mg of caffeine listed and they order ingredients from more to less in a product, we know for sure that everything else listed below (caffeine and) L-theanine are definitely under (100mg) 50mg. Not only that, but this drink has approximately 9mg of crystalline fructose per the entire 14.5 fl oz of the bottle. The ingredients also list sucralose (may be known as Splenda), which is approximately 188 to 588 times sweeter (per gram) than fructose. The drink is almost as sweet as a can of soda, which has 30g of fructose per 12 fl oz can (Neuro bottles are 14.5 fl oz and not as sweet) so this (12 fl oz) can be our baseline estimate. In order to make approximately make NueroGasm almost as sweet as soda they would need something like either 21g more of fructose, or 112mg to 36mg of sucralose. Because of the 50mg of L-theanine we know it's something more like maybe 49mg to 36mg of sucralose. With NeuroGasm not being as sweet as a soda, it's probably on the lower end of that spectrum. The supplements that are listed as less than that sucralose (from greatest to least) in the ingredients are as follows: Alpha GPC, Resveratrol, niacinamide, pyridoxine HCL Thomas cyanocobalamin, and ergocalciferol. The drink has 20mg of niacinamide, which is 100% of your daily value of niacin. Let's take a look at one of those ingredients, Alpha GPC. There's probably somewhere in between 36mg to 21mg of Alpha GPS in this drink. Alpha GPC's usual dosage in supplements is 300mg, which is several times more than what is in this drink. Ultimately it's not surprising that when I finally got to try this drink again that it didn't work at all other than the small 100mg of caffeine and 50mg of L-theanine. The only Neuro drink that is still worth buying is NeuroSleep. At the very least this still tastes pretty good. Read more | 1.0\nThis really helps me on the days I have trouble falling asleep. I drift off much faster, and stay asleep. When I wake up, there is no grogginess. Highly recommend. Read more | 5.0",

It’s a perfect companion for those looking to revitalize their body and mind, whether during a long workday, a challenging workout, or a gaming marathon. One of the standout features of this energy drink is its unique flavor profile. The blend of curuba and elderflower offers a refreshing and slightly sweet taste that’s not overpowering. Unlike some energy drinks that can be too sugary or artificial, this one strikes a nice balance, making it enjoyable to sip on throughout the day. In terms of its energy-boosting properties, Red Bull lives up to its reputation. Each 8.4 fl oz can is packed with essential B-group vitamins (B3, B5, B6, and B12) and 80 mg of caffeine, which is roughly equivalent to a cup of coffee. This combination helps enhance cognitive functions and keep you alert and focused without the jittery feeling that some high-caffeine drinks can cause. The inclusion of taurine, an amino acid that supports cardiovascular health and muscle function, is another plus. It’s reassuring to know that the ingredients used are aimed at providing real benefits, not just a temporary energy spike. Moreover, Red Bull uses real sugar, with a quantity comparable to an equal-sized cup of apple juice, making it a more natural choice compared to other artificially sweetened energy drinks. One thing to note is the safety information: it’s not recommended for children, pregnant or nursing women, and those sensitive to caffeine. This is standard for most energy drinks, but it’s always good to be reminded. The Red Bull Summer Edition Curuba Elderflower is an excellent choice for anyone needing a reliable and tasty energy boost. The unique flavor, combined with its effective ingredients, makes it a standout product in the crowded energy drink market. Whether you’re pushing through a deadline or gearing up for an intense workout, this drink provides a refreshing and invigorating option.

No crashing, perfect amount of caffeine. Yes, I sometimes have more than 1 per day, ha! I’m going to say that Fruit Punch is the best flavor. I have tried almost all of them over the years and always go back to fruit punch. It reminds me of my kids snack type drinks when they were younger, can’t remember the name.

Read more | 5.0\nJust like when I used to order and works well and tastes good and dissolves but expensive. Read more | 4.0\nAs wrestler, I am very concerned with diet, exercise, and getting as much long lasting energy as possible from everything that I eat (yes believe it or not most successful wrestlers do eat. They just know what to eat and when)! Spark is something I live on both in and out of my season! Long lasting energy, no crash, and compared to most energy supplements extremely healthy!! But that's only half the battle. The other half is finding something that tastes good enough that you are actually excited to take it, and spark does just that! Three scoops (which are surprisingly small) of this stuff spread out throughout the day has been enough to get me through grueling tournaments (including my time at the Colorado state tournament) with ease. Personally I mix a scoop of this with a scoop of Accelerade to make the ultimate energy/recovery/rehydration drink I have ever had. And the best part about spark is that it triples as both a preworkout, energy supplement during your workout, or postworkout/rehydration suppliment depending on when you take it. Outside of wrestling, I am a lifter, work at a tire shop, and particpate in many other sports and community service projects. Through it all, Spark is my go to choice for energy when I need it. Not soda, not red bull, not gatoraid, and not other types of quick energy replacement suppliments. Although I am sure these things do work for other people, I have found that Spark is not only the healthiest of these options, but (at least for me) also one of the most effective options as well. Even on those weigh in days for wrestling or just a normal day when no water is available, I love the taste enough to be able to just put the powder straight in my mouth and take it that way. In terms of the actual product, it mixes very well. Minimal clumping even when it might be a little more saturated than normal due to the lack of enough water and it mixes well with other products (such as Accelerade) nicely if you like to do that. Out of the many flavors I prefer the fruit punch the best, however I have tried all the flavors and would not hesitate to buy any of them if the fruit punch was sold out. You do have to rinse your water bottle a few times to get it all out after you drink it but that is pretty typical of any type of supplement or energy drink. If you have never tried Spark before, I know it might look a little pricey, but it is worth the money! I would definitely recommend trying it out! Take it from the wrestler and just an everyday person who has tried just about everything when it comes to energy/rehydration suppliments out there.

    "reviews": "The best energy drink I've ever tasted. Will actually wire you up. Not full of sugar. Subtle, sweet but also tangy with the perfect amount of bite. I pray to the heavens that this will be produced forever. Read more | 5.0\nBest energy drink ever.  Taste is good and it works!!!! Only energy drink I’ll swear by and I’ve tried many.  May make you have to pee a lot but for sure energy all day Read more | 5.0\nHave you ever been in the horrid predicament of wasting away in an infuriatingly hot and humid environment, doomed to stare into the wasteland pondering every terrible decision you've ever made that could have somehow built a debt of karma so wide and deep that even the Mariana Trench feels for you? Then, as if the lord of the sands himself rose from the dust, your only friend approaches your hovel of despair, the man keeping you from just making a pilgrimage to oblivion approaches you, and hands you a Wild Tiger. The metal can could have been soaking in nitrogen it's so cold. The can is so drenched with moisture it reminds you of the time your out of shape ass went to the gym and had to apologize profusely to everyone since there wasn't enough disinfectant in the world to clean yourself or the equipment. Its past midnight, the time and place to question what this beverage could be is long since passed. You open the can. Nothing could prepare you for what happens next. A symphony of horns deafens you, a tiger roars, the smell of syphoned jet fuel and pure uncut caffeine assaults the nose like a Mike Tyson sucker punch. All sense of pride that you carried is most assuredly gone and it took your sanity with it as you hold the perfect matrimony of godly jubilance and satanic fury in your dust covered gloved hand. Your buddy cracks his and the sensations hit you again. You're simply terrified. The pearly gates stand before you. St. Peter is holding a wild tiger. He's smiling. In sheer terror you look to your friend, your companion, your battle buddy. He is smiling and cheers you. The moment the liquid ambrosia touches his lips you see God atop a bengal tiger appear next to you. You chug and all the worries you carried with you for all the lives you've ever lived instantly fade away. A tiger aspirates from beneath you in a black and orange haze. The night is a blur. Your mind opens completely, the questions of the universe get answered. Of course... everything was just so simple. Your friend grins... RIDE THE TIGER BABY! Read more | 5.0\nThe energy drink that we counted on, less the Arabic labeling. This item shipped quickly, was packed nicely, and tastes as good as I remembered. I would gladly purchase from them again. Read more | 5.0\nRip It's may get all the attention, but OG's know riding the tiger is the best. Read more | 5.0\nIf you've ever had Smarties candy or Sweet tarts, the flavor is much like that. In my opinion, the \"serve chilled\" instructions are mandatory, as it is far more refreshing cold. It's a small can, but that also means less total sugar, so if you're not a fan of zero-calorie energy drinks this makes for a good compromise with your sugar addiction if you need to cut back. The drink is very acidic, possibly the most acidic drink I've had on a regular basis. I cannot even think about drinking one until I've had something to eat or it will make me feel sick. Nonetheless, when I'm working through the night and sleep has to wait a bit longer, this really does the trick. I could drink 2 of these and still consume less calories than 1 can of Full Throttle, which has been my go-to for almost 10 years until it has become almost impossible to obtain in my area at a fair price. Read more | 4.0\nMy first introduction into this can of heart palpitations was in 2008 during the surge. We had rip-its and sometimes the rare shock-coffee (if they weren't stolen by the higher HQ), Wild Tiger Energy could actually be bought on the local economy. For 5 dollars American you get a flat of 40. They kept us awake and aware in hostile country. It tastes like a harder redbull. Now let us fast forward 15 years later and I decide to purchase a flat. The price inflated and probably more. After all this is the USA - greatest country on Earth but it also inflates much of its prices. So far, it tastes like I remember. I never drink more than one and it helped when I needed to stay awake on the Night Shift. Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "Peach Tea Diet Green Tea Sweet Tea Peach Lemon Tea Green Tea Diet Raspberry Tea Diet Peach Tea Diet Lemon Tea Blueberry White Arnold Palmer Rx Energy In our family, there's one drink that practically deserves its own shelf: the AriZona Arnold Palmer Half and Half. My son, who's somewhat of a beverage connoisseur—or at least thinks he is—can't get enough of it. I've honestly lost count of how many packs we've been through. Every time I see that familiar box in the pantry, I know another smiling face will greet me soon.There's something about the blend of iced tea and lemonade that just works—a delicate balance of sweet and tangy that feels like a mini vacation in each sip. I tend to think it’s the kind of drink that satisfies on a hot day and pairs perfectly with pretty much any meal. You know, just last weekend, we were having a barbeque and, come to think of it, the Arnold Palmer was the star of the show. The 16 fl oz cans are the perfect size, not too much and not too little, making them convenient for lunches or on-the-go hydration. Now, while I'm partial to a simple glass of water, I have to admit, every once in a while, I’ll sneak a can. And yeah, I'm secretly just as hooked as he is. If you haven't tried it yet, well, all I can say is you're missing out on a refreshingly consistent delight. So, it’s safe to say we’re continuous buyers thanks to my son, but honestly, I don't mind in the slightest. Read more | 5.0\nI recently picked up the Arizona Arnold Palmer in the 192-fluid ounce jug, and it has quickly become a favorite in our household. This beverage is a fantastic blend of iced tea and lemonade, offering the perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. The 192-ounce size is ideal for gatherings or for keeping the fridge stocked with a refreshing drink. It’s great for family dinners, parties, or just for enjoying a cold glass on a hot day. The large jug ensures that we always have a generous supply on hand. The flavor is spot on—neither too sweet nor too tart. The combination of iced tea and lemonade is smooth and refreshing, making it an excellent choice for quenching thirst. It’s a well-loved classic that consistently delivers great taste. The jug is easy to pour and the handle is comfortable to grip, making it convenient to serve. The product is also reasonably priced for the quantity and quality, making it a great value for money. Overall, Arizona Arnold Palmer is a top-notch beverage that combines refreshing flavor with great value. The 192-ounce jug is perfect for keeping everyone hydrated and satisfied. Highly recommended for its taste and convenience! Read more | 5.0\nLove Arizona Green Tea and it's a great price.

    "reviews": "I need caffeine to get through the day.  I just do.  Hey, there are worse things.  But like a lot of people these days, I'm trying to eat healthier and no longer want to ingest unhealthy colas or spend mega dollars to buy \"healthier\" bottled or canned alternatives to get a good amount of caffeine in the form of a cold drink.  I looked at and tried other options, but True Lemon Energy is the best overall I've found to date.  The combination of convenience, zero calories, 120mg of caffeine (from green tea), with no artificial flavors or preservatives was just about everything I was looking for (and it's non-GMO).  So is it perfect?  Of course not.  What is?  It's sweetened with Stevia, which to me has a slight aftertaste, but it's still a helluva lot better than other no-calorie, artificial sweeteners out there so I cut it some slack here.  It's also overly sweet to me as I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I add a couple packets of True Lemon's lemon packets (just pure lemon crystals -- also excellent in tea or plain seltzer as a cheaper and easier alternative to real lemons BTW) to cut the sweetness a bit and it's much better.  They say to add the Energy powder to 16 ounces of water, but I use 26 ounces of filtered water and I find that to work better (and also gets me drinking more water).  The powder isn't the easiest to get to mix thoroughly in cold water -- probably because they don't add any artificial crap to help it do so -- so I bought a 28-ounce Blender Bottle Sportmixer that mixes it perfectly with just a few shakes.  The powder is still doable in a regular cup as long as you add the water first, but I find the Blender Bottle easier and much better at getting all the powder to dissolve completely.  At first I thought these powder tubes were a little pricey at 62 cents per tube when you buy a four pack (24 tubes total) here on Amazon, but given the lack of good alternatives and that True Lemon uses relatively good and healthier ingredients justifies its price to me.  When I think of all the crap I'm no longer putting in my body and the amount of money I'm saving over buying healthy alternatives at the store, I'm really happy with this True Lemon Energy powder.  And my kids like the regular True Lemon powders without the caffeine, and they're so much better than artificial fruit juice mixes and a nice alternative to real fruit juice/boxes with all their calories.  So for all the reasons listed, TL Energy powder gets a high recommendation from me. Read more | 5.0\nI've been using True Lemon Energy packets for several years now.  Everyone always admires my drinks :)  I make Green Tea in place of regular Southern Tea and put 1 packet in my large mason jar with ice.  Then I add blackberries, one orange and lemon slice.  Sometimes, I'll add a fresh mint or basil from my herb garden (southern months).  My favourite ones are Wild Blackberry Pomegranate, Wild Cherry and Raspberry.  In the Summer months I'll switch up and use the more lemon flavours because its so hot out.  So, if you find these packets at a good price drop them in your cart and subscribe!  They can get scarce and expensive and once you get hooked on them it's like soda to wean off of! Read more | 5.0\nWild blackberry pomegranate is delicious and so refreshing. I add one packet to a large water bottle and find I drink so much more water this way. I appreciate the extra energy boost to keep me going. Read more | 5.0\nI really wanted to like this based on the reviews. However the taste is awful! Waste of $$$ Read more | 1.0\nJust the drink to get started or for a pick me up. You get caffeine with out all the added chemicals and with out a crash a couple hours later! Mixes great with water, no clumping or product left on bottom of glass! They also make a version with out caffeine that is also very good! Both has 0% sugar, great alternative to sugary drinks! I also love the little packets, so easy to carry in your pocket or purse and the price is extremely affordable compared to many energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nIf you want caffeine that will hit fast and hard, these are great. They have a good amount of caffeine in each packet, but not excessive amounts. They will give you a bit of energy without the usual crash. I’ve been a true citrus fan for the last three or four years. That whole time I had been buying them from grocery stores because idk why I didn’t think to look on Amazon. These are roughly half the cost of purchasing in store though. Fantastic value. The flavor is a bit tart and could be off putting for some drinkers. If that’s something that you might not like, only use half of a packet per 16oz. I love that the ingredients are stupid simple and all natural. I also love the fact that there is no aspartame (Phenylketonurics) as these are linked to serious health risks and give me horrible migraines. Read more | 5.0\nShake it! Shake it!

    "reviews": "Aphrodite Edition: Pomegranate Acai Poseidon Edition: Blueberry Guarana Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) I was recently introduced to Poseidon Energy Drink and I must say, it has been a complete game changer in my daily routine. This isn't just another energy drink. Poseidon offers a unique and healthier twist to conventional energy drinks that are often laden with harmful chemicals. The first thing that grabbed my attention was Poseidon's commitment to using natural ingredients. It's refreshing to see a product in the energy drink market that cares about what consumers are putting into their bodies. I appreciate the fact that I can actually understand all the ingredients on the back of the can! Having tried Poseidon for the first time, I noticed the clean, refreshing taste - it doesn't leave you with that artificial aftertaste that many other energy drinks do. It's clear that there's a real focus on quality with this product. But the real star of the show is the inclusion of L-theanine. This amino acid is known for its ability to promote relaxation without drowsiness, and it definitely lives up to the hype in Poseidon. I was able to get a significant energy boost without the jittery, anxious feeling that I've experienced with other energy drinks in the past. Whether I'm starting my day, needing a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, or gearing up for a workout, Poseidon gives me a steady, balanced energy boost. It's like getting the benefits of a cup of coffee and a without the jitters. I also appreciate the fact that Poseidon doesn't cause a crash after the energy spike. The energy boost is smooth and sustained, which helps me maintain my productivity throughout the day. In conclusion, Poseidon Energy Drink is a superior choice for those seeking a natural, healthy and effective energy boost. It's a fantastic option for anyone who wants to stay energized and focused, without the unwanted side effects of traditional energy drinks. Amazing value for the money.

    "reviews": "I’ve tried a lot of energy drink mixes, but Pure Kick Peach Tea stands out! The flavor is spot-on—refreshing, smooth, and not overly sweet, with just the right balance of peach and tea. It dissolves quickly with no chalky residue, making it super easy to mix on the go. The energy boost is clean and long-lasting—no jitters, no crash, just steady focus and alertness. Whether I’m at the gym, working, or just need a mid-day pick-me-up, this drink mix delivers. Plus, it’s a great alternative to sugary canned energy drinks. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a tasty and effective way to stay energized! Read more | 5.0\nI have been looking for a water enhancer that is coffee flavored that can compare to the discontinued java Mio. This one is close enough. The blood orange is nice and sweet citrusy. The caffeine content is not enough to make you jittery, but enough to wake you up a bit. I prefer these when traveling because coffee tends to make me sleepy. It does have a bit of an artificial sweetener aftertaste, however, it isn't too bad. That is saying something for me who seems to taste pine sol with artificial sweeteners. Read more | 5.0\nI bought these multiple times. I like them a lot. The caffeine actually works and the hydrate ones actually work. They taste good and they’re strong so you can get more flavor if you pour one of them into two different bottles. Read more | 5.0\nThe caffeinated ones are the perfect amount of caffeine for a quick pick me up, taste great  not too strong. Worth it and affordable Read more | 4.0\nThese had become part of my daily life now, taste amazing, 1 of these in a 32 oz water bottle, flavor is intense and taste just like the jolly rancher flavor. Will continue buying. Read more | 5.0\nThe company I usually order from  has been out of the sour apple drinks that I drink all the time so I ordered these to have something similar. These are very good however they are an energy drink and I can only drink them in the morning otherwise I stay up all night. So if it wasn’t for the fact that it was an energy drink, I could drink these all the time because they do have a very good flavor. I do have to use the whole package and a little bit more in my 32 ounce stainless steel Tumblr because I do like my drinks strong. One package or half a package would probably be sufficient for most. This is sour apple so it is a little sour, but not super sour,  but it is very good. Read more | 5.0\nDelicious and great value for money. Gives you the energy to keep you active. Read more | 5.0\nI wouldn't call something with only 55mg of sodium a hydration packet. The flavors are super strong too, even in my 32oz bottle. They are also dyed, so the black cherry especially stains my water bottle/straw. I won't get these again. Read more | 3.0\n5.0",

Zevia is good as well, but I took a few sips and just didn't like the taste at all.  I was thinking what could be bad with strawberry kiwi.  It tasted to me like a bad spiked seltzer, or off brand without the alcohol to help it some lol.

    "reviews": "Wild Cherry Cranberry Cherry Cranberry Blueberry Acai Black Pomegranate Cherry Cranberry & Blackberry I have been using these packets for about six months and have found them to be very useful. It has provided the right amount of caffeine while also tasing delicious. They have been quite helpful for me and have been a good replacement for sodas and additional cups of coffee. The initial taste can be quite strong, but with a big enough water bottle it is diluted enough to taste good. I highly recommend them if you are looking for caffeine packets to mix in with your water. Read more | 5.0\nI love True Citrus, my family was looking for a healthy alternative to gamer drinks and sugary additives and was pleasantly surprised at True Citrus. Many of the flavors are addictive in taste, I love the Cran Cherry energy. It’s so fresh tasting and love the caffeine and vitamin C boost. The regular packs are delicious too to just keep drinking water. Strawberry, Raspberry, Wildberry and lemon lime are very refreshing. The company is great, they exchange flavors so don’t be afraid to try. I love getting my orders all nice and pretty and packaged in bright packaging. Stevia is a great alternative to other sweeteners. It’s great for anyone with a sensitive bladder or prostate. Read more | 5.0\nGreat flavor! Gives the right amount of energy!! Read more | 5.0\nI like most stevia-based sweeteners, but some use a stevia extract that leaves an aftertaste that I find very unpleasant.  Unfortunately, this product contains such an extract.  If you get along well with stevia extracts, this is a very good water flavoring packet.  If not, either avoid it or buy a minimum quantity so you can check it out first. Read more | 4.0\nI like these a lot. The energy It gives you is fast acting but doesn’t give you the jitters. I wish they’d fit more in a box though. I took all of the sticks out of two boxes and put them in a a box that already had them in them. Three packages worth can fit in one box. lol. Not a problem with taste or effectiveness. Just user preference. Read more | 5.0\nOkay, we have been getting all of the regular TrueLemon flavors and we love them. Original Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade, Strawberry Lemonade, Watermelon Limeade.... all delicious. When I saw this one, I had to try it out, because I love blueberry and acai, and I sometimes will add guarana powder to my TrueLemon because it actually masks the bitter flavor of the guarana quite well . So I figured why not try a new flavor and skip a step in getting my caffeine... This tastes like poison. It is so bitter and off-putting... the smell when you open the packet is very fruity sweet blueberry, but when you mix it with water it just goes so foul. It is like you are taking really bitter prescription pills and didn't swallow before they started to dissolve, but the entire drink is like that. No sweet fruity flavor to save the crazy bitter taste... I can't tell if it is because of the caffeine or the acai flavor that they are using, but it just isn't working for this one. These were also quite expensive compared to others, which I was able to justify to myself because I was so excited about the flavor and the addition of caffeine, I figured it was worth it... Do not buy this flavor. Please don't let this one stop you from trying the other flavors (especially the ones I listed above), as they are delicious! But they really messed this one up somehow. Read more | 1.0\nThe best flavor! Wish it was priced like the others though. Read more | 5.0\nI like the aspartame free, but a lot of the packets are hard inside. Read more | 3.0\n5.0\n4.0\n1.0",

    "reviews": "Original Dripscicle Dream Pop Cherry Limeade Taste great. Read more | 5.0\nThis drink is pretty tasty. I'd say it tastes like a combination of sprite and yellow Gatorade. I don't mind the flavor and it's definitely drinkable, but I'd likely choose a different one next time. The description of the product mentions a splash of coconut water, but there is no coconut water in this product. You can see that on the picture of the ingredients. So, I'll minus a star for the slight false advertising there. It has about the same amount of caffeine as two cups of coffee so nothing crazy in it. Unless you are not used to caffeine at all, this should not give you any jitteriness or anything like that. I'd definitely recommend this for a quick pick me up, especially if you don't like coffee. The electrolytes are good to keep you hydrated some. Read more | 4.0\nThe cherry limeade is delicious! What a great new flavor. Read more | 5.0\nCurrently sipping on one of these with some ice. They definitely do remind me of those bomb-pops I used to get from the Ice Cream man as a kid. Not sure about the strength of the caffeine or the energy that it provides for me, but I will after I finish it, and will update this review. There are a lot of ingredients, but that's to be expected with most energy drinks, so you know what you're getting into when consuming energy drinks. They're clearly not as pure as a simple coffee, or tea, but they should be much stronger and kick in quicker and last longer in my opinion. The taste is good IMO, didn't pay much attention to the calorie count, or how bad it is for you since again, this is an energy drink, and it's not meant to be consumed regularly or in stead of a proper meal. Read more | 4.0\nTo start off with the taste, it was pleasantly surprising and I enjoyed every sip. It has a medium fruity flavor close to orange citrus and some grapefruit which is really smooth but bold at the same time, it rolls off your tongue but still has some spice & kick to it. I have NEVER tried a Prime drink (whoah, surprising I must be 1 in a million), and I think the flavor is really unique and one of the better flavors in any recent sodas or caffeinated drinks I've tried. 5/5 As for the energy, you can feel your heart rate go up so that tells me all I need to know. The caffeine ingredients it's made with are Taurine, Inositol, I-theanine, glucuronolactone, 200mg caffeine, which is HIGH. To compare it, it's more than 3 cups of coffee so I would personally only have this if I skip out on coffee for the day. You can 100% notice it and hey, it lives up to the energy drink name. Serving size is 1 can, really you might want to bring it down to half a can. 10 calories only... \"only\" because it's not counting the caffeine. 300mg electrolytes is also a lot and you SHOULD be active after drinking this and that's what it's made for. It's more comparable to an energy sports drink with that many packed into this can. Energy rating 55555/5 because that's what it does to my heart and body temp. This thoroughly left me impressed and wanting more, the flavor is amazing and high quality, you can tell thought went into it. The energy actually has that boost of energy you get, which I noticed only after 30 minutes or so which is insane. I would drink this in moderation however, the amount of caffeine could be a pro or a con but I maybe see the hype around this drink and can now say, yes it's a real energy drink lol! Read more | 5.0\nI've been drinking energy drinks for about 20 years now, always love to try new ones. My favorite in history was Von Dutch in 2006 made by Rockstar in the background. These are closer to the more typical modern drinks that are zero sugar, sweetened with sucralose. Something like Gamer Fuel, Bang, or Reign. However, unlike those, These Prime drinks are NOT cloyingly sweet. They are not overwhelming, and they taste refreshing with just enough tang to them. I like a sour drink, I don't tend to prefer the newer style drinks. However these are the best I've had in that category. The value seems to be better than the other brands too for a case, though I have not watched them long enough to see how the price may fluctuate. These are 200mg caffeine, so slightly above the 160mg standard but well below the crazy 300's. I like all of the ingredients. They even have potassium and magnesium! The electrolytes add to the smoothness in their drinkability, slightly like monster which uses mostly standard salt for that. Probably my favorite thing about these is that they don't go crazy on the B vitamins. They have a reasonable 150%  of 6 and 12. The Dripsicle flavor is spot on for the \"freedom pop\" flavor. It tastes like a less sweet slightly tart cherry blue raspberry Sprite if that were a thing. I look forward to trying other Prime flavors now that they are very much on my map. Read more | 5.0\nI am not a big Prime energy drink user, but I like energy drinks especially to build up to an afternoon workout. The sucralose fake sugar flavor is present and OK. It tastes a bit like fake sweetener, but unless you want a sugar calorie injection it is almost impossible to find a tolerable energy drink without fake sugar so I do not ding this drink for its sucralose (and maybe one other fake sweetener?). The flavor of cherry limeade--now, I do not know how they landed on this formulation. To me this tastes almost nothing like cherry limeade. Maybe I would believe it is key lime pie. There is some fake spice flavor like a cinnamon or nutmeg that comes through. It is strange and I feel like I have to turn off my brain to drink this. I would try another flavor next time. My husband disagreed with me about the flavor. He felt that he could taste both the cherry and the lime but that the drink had a mouthfeel that was quite thick and syrup-y and that was the only thing that he felt was strange. Read more | 4.0\nThis flavor ain’t it. I’m typically a fan of cherry lime but this ain’t it. Bad after tastes almost leaves your tongue feeling like you ate too much sugary candy Read more | 1.0",

    "reviews": "Tangerine Pineapple Mango Lemon Lime Dragon Fruit Variety I was an avid energy drink person to avoid ~other substances~ when going out with friends OR using crazy pre-workout when exercising. The ingredients in other energy drinks are plain scary and ones I'm trying to avoid at all costs. With that, the sugar content is ABSURD so I needed to find a good replacement. I saw these in an article for organic energy drinks and had to try it out. They sadly don't sell single cans anywhere near me, so I ordered on Amazon. It's relatively the same price buying through Nooma with their subscription so couldn't hurt. I was really impressed! No the taste is not always very delicious (the lime flavor was definitely the worst, weird medicine taste but I got through it), it isn't overly sugary, great ingredients, lions mane and ashwagandha to keep you sane. All in all a great product to use as pre-workout, drink before a night out OR to just get you through the day. I'm pretty caffeine sensitive so I have to be careful with these drinks, they're so easy to drink half and stay up all night! I usually drink about a 1/3 of the drink and it definitely wakes me up and gets me through whatever I need to get through. No itchiness, no weird caffeine symptoms. 10/10 Read more | 5.0\nI am sure the energy part is fine but you can't get more than 2 sips in before you make an ugly face and place it down.

So get ready for some natural taste! 👍👍 Read more | 4.0\nGreat product just wasn’t satisfied with the flavors. But I’m always looking for clean products and this checked the boxes for that!

It brings my alertness right up and does not cause me to have the jitters or upset stomach. After lunch, if I need a pick me up, I will drink one or even half a can and save the rest for the next day. Wearing a mask has further decreased my electrolytes and my chiropractor said to increase them, NOOMA fits the bill perfectly. Real ingredients in each can do not leave a horrible after taste. I like all the flavors, but Dragon Fruit is my most favorite.  Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI have been using NOOMA now for a few weeks and like their drinks. My first order came in without issue, however my latest order came in with opened/damaged cans and what looked like mold/dirt. I ended up have to toss the order because cans were either open, damaged, or covered in mold/dirt. There doesn’t appear to be a policy for getting replacement items. Good drink, unfortunate packing/delivery. Read more | 1.0\nThis is the healthiest energy drink out there. The taste is not great, this is why it's the healthiest.

    "reviews": "Watermelon Limeade Watermelon Raspberry Lemonade Rainbow Sherbet Pineapple Raspberry Medley Orange Pineapple Melon Punch Fruit Punch Cherry Pomegranate Blue Raspberry Strawberry Pina Colada I use this almost everyday. This is my favorite flavor and it I get it way faster from Amazon than the manufacturer. I put it in a little warm water to dissolve it well. Then fill up my cup with ice. My kids say it dissolves fine in a bottle of water shaken also. It is not chalky or gritty so it is very drinkable.  It gives me the same if not more of a pick me up as coffee does. The quality is the same as buying from GFuel. Read more | 5.0\nThe G Fuel Fruit Punch Tub is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to boost their energy and endurance with a delicious and effective supplement. With 40 servings packed into a 9.8 oz tub, this formula delivers impressive performance and great value. The fruit punch flavor is a standout. It's vibrant and refreshing, offering a fruity burst that makes every sip enjoyable. The taste is well-balanced, not too sweet or overpowering, making it easy to drink even during intense workouts or long gaming sessions. In terms of performance, G Fuel Fruit Punch does not disappoint.

Its delightful flavor, effective formula, and convenient packaging make it a top pick for enhancing your energy levels and endurance. Highly recommended for its great taste and powerful performance! Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the G Fuel Hype Sauce Energy Drink Powder, and while the flavor is great—fruity and refreshing with a nice tang—I wasn’t a fan of how powdery it feels. No matter how much I shook or stirred, I couldn’t fully get rid of that gritty texture. It’s almost like there’s always a little excess powder floating around, which made it less enjoyable to drink. That said, it does give a nice energy boost, and the taste is on point. If you don’t mind a bit of powderiness at the bottom of the cup or like mixing it into a smoothie to mask the texture, it’s still a solid energy drink. Overall, G Fuel Hype Sauce has great flavor and energy-boosting power, but if you’re picky about the texture, you might find it a bit too powdery. Read more | 4.0\nI've been a fan of G Fuel for a long time, ever since I discovered their amazing flavors and formulas that give me the boost I need to dominate in my favorite games. Whether it's Call of Duty, Fortnite, or Among Us, G Fuel always helps me stay focused, alert, and energized. Plus, it's sugar-free, gluten-free, keto-friendly, and packed with antioxidants and vitamins. What more could you ask for? But when I heard about their latest flavor, Hype Sauce, I was intrigued. Raspberry lemonade? That sounds delicious! And the packaging is so cool: it features the trippy illustrations of Brooklyn-based artist Mike Perry, who collaborated with G Fuel to create this exclusive flavor. The tub is bright pink and yellow, with a funky design that screams \"HYPE\". I couldn't wait to try it out. So I ordered a tub from their website (which was super easy and fast), and it arrived in a few days. I opened it up and smelled the powder: wow! It smelled like fresh raspberries and lemons, with a hint of sweetness. It made my mouth water instantly. I scooped one serving (7 grams) into 16 ounces of water and shook it well. The powder dissolved quickly and turned the water into a vibrant pink color. I took a sip and... OMG! It was amazing! It tasted exactly like raspberry lemonade, but better. It was refreshing, tangy, sweet, and smooth. It had no artificial aftertaste or chalkiness. It was like drinking liquid candy, but without the guilt. It was so good that I finished the whole bottle in minutes. But how did it make me feel? Well, let me tell you: it made me feel awesome! Within 10 minutes of drinking it, I felt a surge of energy and focus that lasted for hours. I felt more alert, more creative, more motivated, and more confident. Hype Sauce definitely lived up to its name: it hyped me up like nothing else. It also improved my mood and boosted my immunity, which is always a plus in these crazy times. And best of all: it had zero sugar and only 15 calories per serving. How awesome is that? So what's my verdict? Well, if you haven't guessed by now: I love Hype Sauce! It's one of my favorite flavors from G Fuel ever (and trust me, I've tried them all). It's delicious, refreshing, energizing, and mood-enhancing. It's perfect for gamers who want to level up their performance and have fun at the same time. It's also great for anyone who needs a pick-me-up during the day or night. Read more | 5.0\nI like G Fuel as a brand. I know that excessive amounts of B vitamins aren't great for my health long term. However, caffeine consumption is an almost unavoidable habit for most of us. Cans of G Fuel have long been a favorite drink of mine, and the cost of buying the powder (especially if you can get it on sale!) makes this habit so much more affordable. After a slight trial and error testing of the amount of powder needed in a scoop for my drink shaker, and an adjustment period of that EVER SO SLIGHT powder taste. I will say that this has been a very nice investment that allows me to have to make those late-night QT runs or spend more money on the cans in the long run. My advice is to buy a few different flavors you like so you can mix up drinks, that way you don't get burnt out on the same consistent flavor.

    "reviews": "Just the right energy boost when I need it the most. Very delicious, excellent quality. Makes me feel good and energized. Read more | 5.0\nThis was a great tasting drink and doesn’t have an aftertaste like other sparkling waters (which I don’t like). It has a good sparkling fruit flavour. The drink is smooth going down and it is very refreshing and it keeps you awake all day while only being 70mg of caffeine. This goes to show you that you don’t have to have a high caffeine content like 200mg. You will stay alert, calm and you stay focused even when watching a movie without feeling tired later as some energy drinks make you feel. As an added bonus, I like that this drink specifically is made with real fruit juice so you know it’s healthier and with vitamins added too. Some drinks say 0% juice. You know this is good when you have three left. I will definitely be buying this again. Read more | 5.0\nSeriously, I can't get enough of this stuff. The flavor is so good—like a refreshing burst of berry magic that actually tastes natural and not like some weird artificial concoction. And the best part? No jitters or weird crashes because the caffeine isnt too high but everything was high enough to help my mind in work. It gives me all the energy and focus I need to power through my day without feeling like I'm bouncing off the walls. If you’re looking for an energy drink that’s smooth and delicious without the downside, Alpine Bliss is where it’s at. Trust me, you need this in your life. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is good, but it offers no energy. It is too expensive to not work. I would not buy again. Read more | 1.0\nDon't typically drink drinks that contain real fruit juice, but this beverage was fairly low calorie/carb AND used high quality juices (like strawberry juice), so I decided to give it a try. Have been looking for additional energy drink options that are healthier and more effective (better focus without a crash) - this drink covered those boxes! I felt like this gave me more focus without giving me a \"jolt\" or crash. I didn't feel like this majorly affected my blood sugar levels either. I also really liked the taste; it was fruity and tart but not foul/artificial. Witih only 70mg of caffeine, this would be a better midday drink option so it doesn't interfere as much with bedtime. If you're looking for a redbull alternative, this is a great option! Read more | 5.0\nI'm extremely happy with Alpine The wild berries flavor is spot-on, everything on this drink is good for someone like me who’s always on the go and daily, as an Active duty member I enjoy this energy drink on my daily! Perfect for workouts, studying, or daily productivity, just pure energy. Some of my favorite things about it - Unique flavor - Rapid, sustained energy - Natural ingredients - No crash or jitters Highly Recommended! Read more | 5.0\nI bought this product for energy in which it did everything it said it would do. Great taste, energy, and cognitive thinking. I love that it had 5 grams of sugar and barely any calories gave me energy and no crash and had a great berry flavor. I would recommend to anyone who likes energy drinks they are a little pricey. If you are looking for energy without the calories and the sugar this drinks for you!!! Read more | 4.0\nI purchased these Alpine Bliss Drinks as a new alternative to my other caffeine products and they didn’t disappoint! They’re a perfect convenient size being only 8.4 oz but they have 70mg of caffeine, a great pick me up, I actually felt great the rest of the day after drinking! Price wise they’re super great being only about $3 per can so I don’t feel guilty buying them. They’re surprisingly sweet considering they only have about 5g of sugar but have a great berry flavor with no weird aftertaste & the ingredients look great to me. I’d definitely recommend these and will likely continue to purchase them! Read more | 5.0",

    "reviews": "Strawberry Peach Pineapple Passionfruit Blackberry Lemonade Variety As a Rock climber that tried countless energy drinks, KENETIK is on a whole different level. Unlike traditional caffeine-based options, this ketone-powered formula delivers clean, sustained energy without the jitters or inevitable crash. It’s the perfect solution for staying sharp and focused throughout the day, whether I’m grinding through work, rock climbing, or needing a mental boost. What I love: -No caffeine, no sugar – No sudden energy spikes or crashes, just smooth, sustained fuel. -Amazing focus & mental clarity – The Ketone benefits are real! I feel sharper and more productive. -Great taste & variety – The flavors are refreshing and enjoyable without being overly sweet. Read more | 5.0\nI recently purchased the Kenetik ketone drink variety pack in cans from Amazon, and I was pleasantly surprised. I've been exploring the potential benefits of ketones for a while, and Kenetik seemed like a reputable brand. The cans are convenient and easy to take on the go, making it easy to incorporate into my daily routine. The flavors were surprisingly enjoyable. I tried the variety pack which included Blackberry Lemonade, Strawberry Peach, and Pineapple Passion Fruit. All three were pretty good and can be a bit sour until you get used to it - that’s the ketones. I noticed a noticeable boost in energy about 30 minutes after drinking it. I also felt more focused and less jittery than I sometimes get with caffeine. The effects lasted for a while, which was great. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase of the Kenetik ketone drink variety pack in cans. The convenience, taste, and energy-boosting effects make it a great option for anyone looking to try ketones. Read more | 5.0\nLove this drink. I Have been drinking daily for a few months now. I feel a difference when I forget to drink one. Do not notice a change in energy per day, but more on mental clarity. I do wish the supply chain would get figured out though. Sometimes my order comes late because it is sold out! my BIGGEST complaint is the packaging. On 3 separate orders I’ve had leaking cans in the case. Leaving a rancid smell, almost like the smell of when you used to return cans in the back of the grocery store way back In the day!  If you know, you know!!! Read more | 5.0\nMy wife and I wanted to try the drink from watching roman Atwood. We tried all 3 flavors and by far prefer the pineapple.  As for effectiveness it's okay doesn't pack a punch like others. First drink of it slightly sour but you can tell it's all natural. Now as you can see Celsius a energy drink I drink often has less calories, less sodium and more vitamins at a cost of $2.50 compared to 5 dollars. Also of you have acid reflux, or get heart burn easy stay away from kenetik it will cause it to flair up. All in all it's a good quality product, im glad I tried it, as for the value for the money all natural yes, would I spend 5$ a can on it probably not again.  The product is good but I think it needs some tweaks on it still. Like sodium levels and acid levels in it Read more | 3.0\nHaving a hard time deciding between this flavor and the pineapple passionfruit one as the best. Gives you good energy.

    "reviews": "Sour Apple Watermelon Strawberry Lemonade Pomegranate Mango Peach Grape Berry The only energy drink that actually works. Read more | 5.0\nI've ordered these from this seller before, but delivered by private couriers and the bottles and box were pretty beat up. These delivered by Amazon are perfect! I like these energy drinks and compare them to a 5 hr Energy. I feel like all energy shots work better for me to take 1/2 of an extra strength if available vs a whole regular strength. These are the same for me in that respect. Both these and 5 hr do tend to give me jittery energy with an inevitable crash, but the shots that don't do that to me are over $3 each. Bang for your buck can't be beat. If you like 5 hr Energy shots, you should try these, it's hard to justify their price though if these work for you. I have no idea what \"warmth\" is in reference to this product. It does not give me the sweats quite as badly as a 5 hr, but both do a little. I suppose I like the flavor, but the flavor of an energy shot is simply not something I care about at all... perhaps b'c I think they all taste equally gross and I am grateful there is only an ounce. That said, to this is a pretty good flavor. It's pretty sour, but you can almost taste or maybe smell something mango or peach like. Read more | 5.0\nIt gives me a little more energy - Sometimes.  I don’t take it religiously, maybe if I did, I’d be able to give a proper review. Read more | 4.0\nFound this at my local gas station intrigued by the name I tried it out. Took one shot and ended up doing a DEEP clean of my car that I’ve been meaning to do. Super focused, sustained energy and I’m a caffeine junky so I immediately went online to buy the box. (I also noticed “down there” had more “energy” thanks to the added yohimbine) worth the money very cheap Read more | 5.0\nIntact, seals not broken. Read more | 5.0\nI want to start off by saying that I was really excited for this. I love sour apple candy, and I am trying to find the best energy shots I can (I prefer them over pre-workout). I'll list my findings below. Taste: hardly any, certainly not sour. It kind of tastes like watered down apple powder. Mostly water. 60% water, 30% apple, 10% citric acid. And again, not sour—even with the citric acid. Effect: None. Supposedly there's two servings of 172 mg of caffeine in this bottle, but I drank half of the bottle and felt literally nothing. My normal energy shots have anywhere between 150 and 220 mg of caffeine, and I usually have to pace myself through one of those. With this, I felt literally nothing. I waited a half an hour, nothing. **Edit: I drank an entire shot and felt the TINIEST bit of the caffeine. Value for money: If this product worked, it would be a fantastic value for money. You get quite a bit for not very much. I was pretty disappointed with this, and I really wish that weren't the case. I wanted this to be good: I really enjoy a good energy shot, and I love Sour Apple. No idea how this got the rating it got, but I'm glad somebody else enjoys it. If you do, keep supporting them, please. Check out the Daily Power energy shot in blue raspberry, those are good and are like a punch in the face. I just wanted to try something new. Read more | 1.0\nI've been using these for sometime, and they get the job done as far as giving you an energy boost.  However they were poorly packaged by someone who could obviously care less about what they're doing or the customer.  The boxes the dozen bottles come in were beaten to a degree where it looks like someone ran over them with a car.  They were also stained all over by an unknown liquid (although it was not from the bottles themselves, each being  intact).  I highly recommend the product, but you're taking your chances on receiving them undamaged. Read more | 3.0\nThe flavor is OK but not my favorite. Read more | 5.0",
