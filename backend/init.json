    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to! The flavor is AMAZING! Energy is AMAZING! And it’s perfect for someone on keto looking for an energy boost! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n1.0\n4.0"

    "reviews": "Peach Tea Berry Bestsellers Variety I love Gorgie energy drinks. They give you a nice boost of energy that lasts and doesn’t give you a crash. I like that they’re made with green tea for energy and also have vitamins like biotin and b vitamins. I love the different flavor options, you can make a decent mocktail/cocktail from them too. They’re pretty clean as far as an energy drink goes. I do feel like they’re a better choice as far as energy drinks are concerned because they’re ingredient list so clean and the energy source seems better for you. I’ve been buying them for a few months now, this time I committed to a 12 pack because I drink them so regularly now. I genuinely enjoy them and the benefits I see. It helps lift my midday crash without any weird side effects. Definitely a favorite of mine and definitely would recommend. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been looking for a great tasting, clean energy drink for quite some time and finally found it.  The Gorgie energy drinks are phenomenal! I got the variety pack and my favorite is hard to pick but I’m going to go with watermelon splash! I like the energy I get from this product which comes from green tea. There is no shaky feeling or digestion issues.  I love that there is no sugar in this product and how there is only 5 calories. This is so easy to drink and I like it best refrigerated! This is definitely my new go to energy drink and I highly recommend it! Read more | 5.0\nThe drink is a bit expensive but for an alternative to regular caffeine, price to performance is not bad. I drank one around 2pm and couldn’t sleep till 3am, but that is only because I don’t drink a lot of caffeine regularly. One of the things I like the most about this is that it did not hurt my stomachs. Normally when I have any energy drink like monster or redbull it hurts my stomachs afterwards and generally causes me problems. So far this has not happened at all drinking this. As far as taste goes it tastes like mildly sweet sparkling water, nothing amazing but not super bad. Read more | 4.0\nI had the opportunity to try Gorgie’s Bestsellers Variety Pack, and I absolutely love that it delivers a smooth energy boost without any jitters! It’s refreshing to find an energy drink that works effectively while being functional for daily use.One thing to note is that the flavors didn’t quite hit the mark for me. While I enjoyed the Mango and Watermelon the most, I found that the overall taste could use some refinement. I also noticed that shaking the cans well before drinking made a significant difference in the experience, though the flavor profile was still not quite to my liking. I truly appreciate the brand’s dedication to clean ingredients and performance-driven beverages. With some adjustments to the flavors, this could easily become a go-to option for many! Read more | 3.0\nReally love having a Gorgie every day to help me through my mid day slump! Each flavor is fantastic and I love all of the added functional ingredients. They have a great amount of carbonation and a strong flavor. I don’t get any jitters after drinking. Love the bright colored cans! Read more | 5.0\nI picked one of these up at the grocery store and then order a pack. I was surprised to see it wasn’t rated that highly. I love these! They taste great and give a good boost. I have tried all the flavors and like them all. I’m pretty picky about sugar substitutes and am pretty sensitive to the bitter aftertaste they can leave, even stevia. But these taste good. Definitely the best healthy/natural energy drinks I’ve ever had! Read more | 5.0\nI love how there are great ingredients in this product, and how they don't overload on biotin which can cause acne when you get too much. I love 3/4 flavors in this variety pack and the peach flavor is only okay. It is a little too syrupy and fake sugar flavored for my tastes, but it is tolerable usually. However, the last time I received this product the peach flavor was adulterated. There were giant chunks of this like chalky substance throughout the drink and reporting the issue did not result in any fixes. Therefore, I cannot trust this product in the future. Read more | 2.0\nI love the ingredients used, and it works. I got the variety pack bc I wanted to taste the flavors. I don't like the Mango and definitely do not like the peach tea. I didn't realize it was peach tea flavor, I just thought is was peach. Read more | 4.0"

    "reviews": "Root Beer Peach Mango Orange Sunrise Grape Dr. Bum Citrus Burst Cherry Frost Champion Mentality Blueberry Lemonade Blue Snow Cone Pink Lemonade I love BUM Energy drinks, I can't get enough of them, I guess you could say I'm addicted, a true BUMaholic(TM). Sorry Chris, can't use that one. BUM Energy drinks are unique. They taste like a soda, feel like a soda, and look like one. I'm tired of the overly sweet, 300mg caffeine energy drinks trying to get the biggest can out there for consumer gluttony. So when I found BUM, I gave it a try and became hooked. BUM energy drinks give you a slight caffeine boost and uptick in mental clarity. I enjoy a cup or two of coffee in the morning, but in the afternoon I'll drink one of these to keep me going before a workout. I have had almost every flavor of BUM, there is still the elusive pink lemonade I haven't been able to find yet. But for flavor ratings: Cherry Frost : tastes like a Cherry Cola. The best in my opinion. Root Beer: does have a slight \"diet\" flavor, but the best of the root beer energy drinks I've had. If you enjoy root beer you'll enjoy this. Cirtus Blast: If you're familiar with Sprite or 7up, this is very similar: crisp, clean citrus flavor. Champion Mentality: tough choice between this and orange sunrise. Champion Mentality takes this spot for me because it is lighter on the sweetness. Slightly more tart flavor than Citrus Blast. Orange Sunrise: A bit, sweet, but not too much. Almost like an orange popsicle, but very refreshing. Blue Snow Cone: its been a while since I have had this one, a little harder to find at times. It's a sweet flavor, very reminiscent of the \"blue\" flavor of similar drinks. IYKYK Blueberry Lemonade: this is tangy, very slight blueberry flavor with a tangy, acidic after taste. I find this to be a refreshing, sipping beverage. It gets me excited for the pink lemonade! Peach Mango: I'm a huge fan of these two flavors and the combination had me excited. I found it to be a little on the sweet side with a bit more \"diet\" taste. Still a very refreshing drink and one to try if you're a fan of the flavor combination. If you haven't tried BUM Energy drinks yet, you're missing out on the best energy drinks out there. For those of you who like energy drinks, give these a try. One sip and you'll be hooked, switching from the Reigns, Bangs, Monsters, etc. You just cannot beat the quality of these drinks, you get no jitters or crash, just clean energy. Chris, how about a simple \"Cola\" flavor? And don't change the cans, I love the simplicity of a 12oz soda can. Read more | 5.0\nI'm writing because the review checker gives the quality of reviews on this listing an F... but I purchased this product bc I'm trying to lower the amount of caffeine I drink (I was drinking A LOT for me to be coming down to BUM's level). Suffice to say, I've now gone through one pack and I am now a customer. the product is EXCELLENT. Just enough caffeine, it's not a giantic can of drinnk so you don't feel bloated like with a monster or ghost or rockstar and above all... The ROOTBEER is EXCELLENT. Like wow, the taste is great. Cannot emphasize to you that after drinking dozens of brands over the decades that this one is a stand out. I am waiting on their Dr. Bum flavor... and I wish they would come out with a Cola flavor but so far, I want to commend them on a great product in the midrange Caffeination (is that word? IS NOW !) for folks who are discovering that their kidneys might matter in the future. KEep up the good work Bum! Read more | 5.0\nGreat product, the flavor is on point and ingredients are awesome! I love the lowered amount of caffeine (compared to similar energy drinks). Read more | 5.0\nLove the taste and the right amount of caffeine in it. It is better than any other energy drink out there. Read more | 5.0\nI use this as a pre-workout before cardio or hitting the weights and it gives me a great boost to my routine, best part is, no crazy crash afterwords, and it tastes amazing! Definitely buying more! Read more | 5.0\nThe root beer flavor tastes just like root beer, no weird after taste or artificial sweetener flavor. The caffeine pick-me-up is just right, enough to wake me up but not too strong to cause jitters or a crash. Read more | 5.0\nTastes great, but the first box had a bunch of damaged cans Read more | 4.0\nI use the everyday in the morning. It has replaced all caffeinated drinks for me. It energizes me enough to get through a work out and an entire day of work. Would recommend it to anyone that wants better energy and more focus. Read more | 5.0"

    "reviews": "Mixed Tray Blueberry Tart Orange Cream VALR Energy has quickly become my favorite energy drink! The flavor is perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and it gives me hours of smooth, focused energy without the jitters or dreaded crash. Knowing it’s made with natural ingredients makes it an easy, guilt-free choice for staying energized throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the two flavor pack with Orange Cream and Blueberry Tart. Orange Cream was my personal favorite out of the 2. As someone that is picky with energy drinks, I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. Neither had that fake energy drink taste that some of the other brands on the market have. The were tasty but not too sweet. The caffeine content was perfect to give you mental focus but none of the weird jittery feeling. I felt focused and awake all day without any crash also! The nitrogen gives the drinks a little bit of carbonation without being overpowering. As someone that also prioritizes their health, I really like that this brand has clean ingredients and is more geared toward a healthy lifestyle. 10/10 would buy again and recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using VALR Nitrogen Infused energy drinks for a few weeks now, and I’m impressed with the boost they provide without the usual jitters. As an active mother, I need something that helps with both focus and stamina during my workouts, and this does the trick. The smooth, refreshing taste makes it easy to enjoy, and I love that it doesn’t leave me feeling drained later on. Overall, it’s a great energy drink that supports my busy lifestyle Read more | 5.0\nI’m usually pretty hesitant to try most energy drinks because they make me jittery and often taste like chemicals, but I decided to try VALR because of the green tea extract and nitrogenation.. and this is actually delicious! The nitrogen makes the liquid feel thicker/gives the satisfaction of carbonation, without the actual bubbles or gas aftermath.  I got the variety pack to try both flavors- the orange reminded me of an orange and cream sorbet, and the blueberry (my fav) literally just tasted like blueberry green tea. I have the mental and physical energy, without feeling anxious or shaky. Definitely recommend at least giving them a try!! Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who's pretty sensitive to caffeine, this was a nice mid-day pick me up and I could feel my alertness level rise after drinking less than half the can, no jitters. The sweetness level works for me (I like sweet drinks) and the fact that it's infused with nitrogen makes for a really smooth texture that felt like a treat. I'm going to start having one before my workout classes. Orange is my fav - will continue to repurchase! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of an energy drink consumer because most of the drinks on the market have way too much caffeine! The can only has 175mg of caffeine through green tea. I did not experience any weird jitters or crashes after drinking the entire can. The other things I love about the product is its focus on natural juices and flavoring as well as it being nitrogenated. I was also able to drink an entire can before a workout with no bloat that you would typically get from a carbonated drink making my workout comfortable. This is a great product! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been searching for a clean, effective energy drink, and VALR is now my go-to. The taste is refreshing and not overly sweet, which I love. It provides a steady energy boost that keeps me focused for hours without the jittery feeling or crash I’ve experienced with other brands. Plus, it’s packed with natural ingredients, which makes me feel good about drinking it. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nVALR is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the orange, but the blueberry is also super satisfying. I was expecting carbonation like other energy drinks, but the nitrogenated texture was a pleasant surprise. It’s a bit thicker but without the carbonation, so no burping side effects! I’m focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough protein while leading a healthy lifestyle. One thing I love about Valr is that it mixes perfectly with my clear protein powder for a refreshing, energizing boost. It’s delicious on its own and even better with protein. I can’t say enough great things about this energy drink! The energy boost from Valr is different from other drinks. It doesn’t give me a big spike and then a crash. Instead, it provides a natural, lasting boost that maximizes my focus, energy levels, and attentiveness, making it a great companion for my workday mornings. I’m a die-hard fan of the orange flavor and can’t wait to start all my days with it. I’ll be ordering another case soon! I would love to try other flavors as they come out with new ones!

    "reviews": "I snagged a 12-pack of CELSIUS Sparkling Kiwi Guava, and dude, it’s my new pre-workout jam! The kiwi-guava combo is tart, sweet, and tropical—sips like a vacation vibe. No sugar, no junk like aspartame or high fructose corn syrup, just clean energy from green tea and guarana. I felt the kick without the jitters, thanks to that MetaPlus blend with B vitamins and chromium—kept me pumped and not starving mid-run. It’s vegan, gluten-free, and Kosher, so it fits my picky diet. The 12 oz. slim cans are clutch for on-the-go. Only beef? It’s fizzy, so if you’re not into carbonation, heads-up. Otherwise, it’s a solid pick-me-up for crushing goals and staying fit without the usual energy drink crash. CELSIUS, you’ve got a fan! Read more | 5.0\nThe CELSIUS Arctic Vibe Sparkling Frozen Berry is my absolute go-to energy drink! As a mom of three, working from home, and streaming, I need something to keep me going—and this does the job without the crash! What I Love: ✔ Great Flavor – The Frozen Berry taste is refreshing and not overly sweet. It’s my favorite from the Celsius lineup! ✔ Clean Energy Boost – Gives me just the right amount of energy without the jittery feeling. Perfect for long work hours and late-night streams. ✔ No Crash – Unlike other energy drinks, I don’t feel sluggish after it wears off. ✔ Zero Sugar, But Still Tastes Great – Love that it’s sugar-free yet still delicious and satisfying. ✔ Keeps Me Productive – Whether it’s chasing my kids, grinding through work, or keeping up with my gaming sessions, this drink helps me stay focused and energized. Read more | 5.0\nI love Celsius. In my opinion they are the best energy drink out there! Especially the strawberry lemonade. it’s so good! Not overly sweet ,but just right! Great for a refreshing tasty boost of energy! And also great value. The 12 pack is at a very reasonable price! Read more | 5.0\nFor this price I couldn't pass these up. I had never had this flavor before, but man It taste good. Unlike other energy drinks Celsius gives that boost of energy while not making you feel as bad afterwards. I would give it 10 stars if possible. Read more | 5.0\nI did not get the flavors pictured and I got 2 cans of each flavor and they were quite inferior flavors compared to the better ones. I did not like apple cherry, peach vibe is fine but not as good.

The orange is not overly sweet, it tastes like real OJ, and there is a wonderful hint of marshmallow that is spot on. The drink is not too fizzy, not too sweet, not overly caffeinated, and it actually tastes very good! Read more | 5.0\nAs part of my fitness regimen, I started drinking Celsius zero energy drink to boost my performance. Since I began consuming the drink, I have observed improved energy levels during workouts and faster perspiration. I am particularly fond of the peach, fruit punch, and tropical pineapple flavors. Considering the cost, I believe it offers good value for money. However, I must note that the drink contains caffeine, which can cause stomach irritation if I consume the entire can. To avoid this issue, I limit my intake to half a can. Read more | 5.0\nThis is the perfect energy drink I will ever get.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Bundle C4 Smart Energy Official Variety Pack Watermelon Burst Tropical Passion-fruit Tropical Oasis Variety Pack Strawberry Guava Peach Mango Nectar Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Yuzu Black Cherry Berry Breeze Variety Pack C4 Brain & Body Official Variety Pack Cherry Berry Lime The media could not be loaded. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost. I still prefer Rockstar or Monster overall. Read more | 4.0\nCellucor is the best energy drink on the market.  The flavors are great, and just the right amount of energy.

    "reviews": "Tropical Thrill Son of a Peach Rizzberry and Cream Red Ryder Punch Orange Drizzle OG Luck Bodacious Berry Variety Pack When I performed a search for energy drinks, Lucky Energy appeared as a sponsored result. Curious to learn more, I clicked on it. I was moved by the creators backstory and why Lucky energy became a thing. Upon looking at the range of flavor profiles offered, I went with the variety pack. However, at an almost eye watering $30 for just 10 cans, I was hesitant at first but nonetheless they arrived the next day. Again, love the backstory but also the packaging/design of everything. To me, this is a well put together brand with the different flavors offered and the design of the can. Everyone always asks me what I'm drinking. All in all I like the drink so far, I haven't tried all the flavors just yet but have tried 3 so far and all of them have tasted clean, crisp, and delicious. Not overly sweet like some low sugar/sugar free drinks are with all that fake sweetener and whatnot. This is just right. The only con I can say is the price. Coming in at $3/can is a little higher some might argue. That's what you'd normally pay at a gas station. I'm used to paying anywhere between $1.50/$2 a can when ordering online in bulk. However, at the end of the day this seems to be still a new product and maybe prices will change and times goes on and they get bigger, things get more affordable for them, etc. I can get behind paying the little extra though because I feel good about supporting someone with such a memorable backstory and purpose for a product. I would give these a try if you haven't. Very good and will probably be ordering more at a later date. Read more | 5.0\nMove over Rockstar, Redbull, and Monster. There’s a new king in town, and its name is Lucky Energy. That’s right, I said it: best energy drink out there. And trust me, I’m not throwing that title around lightly as someone who’s basically an energy drink connoisseur. What sets Lucky Energy apart is that it’s made with clean ingredients. Unlike most energy drinks that leave you feeling guilty for what you’re putting into your body, this one feels like a smarter choice. I get all the benefits—energy, focus, and even a surprising mood boost, without that nagging \"am I slowly destroying myself?\" feeling. The energy is smooth, too. There’s no crash, which is honestly a game-changer. I can power through my day without suddenly feeling like I got hit by a truck. Plus, it’s so good that I ended up buying six cases after trying it. Yeah, it’s that good. And the best part? It’s actually cheaper than the big-name brands you find in liquor stores. If you’re looking for an energy drink that works, tastes great, and doesn’t come with a side of regret, Lucky Energy is your answer. Do yourself a favor and stock up, you won’t regret it. Read more | 5.0\nI loved this energy drink, the flavor, size of can and price was reasonable.  Now I go back to buy it again and the flavor is not available in the 19oz can, which is fine because I'm patient and they will restock, but then I see they hiked up the price 10 dollars a 12 pack and the 16oz cans cost 5 dollars more than the original price for the bigger can.  If you find something you like at a great price buy as many as you can cause it's never gonna go down.  Now I can't afford this anymore.  On to the next one.  Happens with everything.  I understand a dollar even 2 but 10.  That's when it's time to move on.  When this happens company's are saying to me, greed is more important than long term loyalty to customer base.  Bait and switch on a lot of products I'm noticing. Read more | 4.0\nThese are my new favorite and goto energy drinks. The OG Luck flavor is really good—not too sweet and no weird aftertaste like so many others I’ve tried. It gives a nice boost of energy without making me feel jittery or crashing later. I like that it has 200mg of caffeine and added ingredients like maca and ginseng for an extra kick. Overall, it’s a solid energy drink that tastes great and works well. Definitely worth trying if you’re looking for a healthier option! Read more | 5.0\nLove the flavor of the organs cream and definitely feel the energy.  Also love the story of the owner of the company Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is okay but has a brewed after taste. Better tasting energy drinks out there for the same or better price. Read more | 3.0\nI dont like coffee particularly but I like a little kick in the mornings so naturally energy drinks have always been my go to. I don't like the high caffeine content of some of them though, there is a such thing as too much buzz. It has a good amount of caffeine but not too much and the ingredients are a lot more basic than others. I like the fact that they use vegetable juice for their colors instead of the nasty food coloring. They seem to be right in line price wise with everybody else. These will be my new go to, from dirt bikes to surfing to work. Read more | 5.0\nOg luck taste great! Taste just like a green monster but with out all the junk monster has in it. You can definitely tell after you've drank a can, it does have a slight taste of the zero sugar but nothing to noticeable after my first can I hardly noticed it. No bad aftertaste doesn't make me jittery and I don't feel like crashing out either. Overall i would definitely recommend this energy drink to anyone willing to give it a shot. I've only tried the og luck so I can't comment on the other flavors but OG Luck is a must try if you like the taste of the green monsters. 4 out of 5 stars because the pricing could be a little cheaper other than that I've seen people complain about damaged cans i haven't had that problem yet my packaging was perfect and was delivered on time. Also this is not a paid review I just wanted to share my experience. Update: Second shipment over half the cans are damaged. Read more | 4.0"

Read more | 5.0\nWow, the reviews for this energy drink are *terrible* - not sure why - but I found this drink to be surprisingly good! It appears that I am in the minority here, but hear me out: Okay, so I have never had a Rockstar energy drink (what can I say, I live a 'sheltered life,' lol); so I honestly cannot compare to previous formulas, like most of the reviewers here have done. That said, I was surprised... and only in a *good* way! There were NO bad \"surprises,\" at all, whatsoever — and no \"cons!\" I have had \"Monster\" energy drinks... and found the taste to be awful. I have had \"Red Bull\" ... and I found those to be *EVEN WORSE!* I literally cannot stomach red bull energy drinks - they are that gross to me! They turn my stomach. They taste like *medicine* to me... actually, no, I've had *medicine* that tastes better! (Sorry, Red Bull fans... but we're gonna have to agree to disagree here, lol) So, I was a little trepidatious — to say the least — when it came to ordering these. (Luckily, I didn't even *look* at the reviews; and I'm so glad I didn't! (I don't say that line very often, lol). So, the day of my first taste came... and I was shocked - and only in a good way!! This is the *ONLY* energy drink that I have ever liked - or can even \"stomach,\" for that matter. Seriously. I love my caffeine — and who can't use a little \"extra\" energy or OOMPH in their day?? As someone who has CFS (Chronic Fatigue Syndrome) and an autoimmune disorder that I've struggled with since *childhood* —  as well as various other health issues, I will say that *I* certainly can! So, anyway, onto the taste: For those that have never tasted this particular drink/flavor, but are familiar with Mountain Dew (I also enjoy many of *their* flavors; *especially* the orange \"Livewire\" - which is my favorite Mt Dew flavor), I will say that, to me, it tastes very much like a subdued (and less carbonated) version of their orange LIVEWIRE. That is the closest thing I can compare it to. It's perfect for me! The pick-me-up was also appreciated - and I also felt it delivered a good \"jolt\" (pun intended) of energy; in other words, it served its purpose and lived up to its name — it gave me some much-needed energy and the taste is great, to me!! If you've never had a Rockstar energy drink, and are not even familiar with the \"old\" formula vs the \"new\" formula and/or you enjoy Mt Dew LiveWire, give this a go!! I think you will enjoy it. If not, I'm sorry but I offer no money-back guarantees, lol. Bottom Line? For those searching for a new energy drink or a new flavor, and are wondering what this tastes like: It's a nice soft, subtle orange-y flavor reminiscent of Live Wire - so if you enjoy Mountain Dew's \"LiveWire,\" I think you would really enjoy this flavor! I did! Obviously, I feel a little \"alone\" in that opinion atm (according to other reviewers) but who cares?! All that matters to me is that I enjoyed it and that it added a little extra pizzaz to my day. I did - and it did! I hope you will enjoy it as well! Salud!

    "reviews": "Watermelon Strawberry Peach Hardcore Apple Berry Sangria Fruit Punch Always great, its really the only flavor I prefer. Love Rockstar! Tastes great, great quality. Always helps me get going in the morning with the caffeine. Priced well below the stores. Read more | 5.0\nI have been drinking Rockstar Punched energy for years. It has always been my favorite energy drink to make it through those extra-long shifts at work or power through tough workouts. The flavor is bold, and yeah, it definitely gives a strong energy kick if that's what I need. It had just about everything one could want: a bunch of caffeine and a load of sugar, too, which always really gave me that immediate kick. But as much as I've enjoyed rockstar over the years, recently I tried Aura caffeine pouches, and man, they're so much better. The first thing I noticed about Aura is how smooth and long-lasting the energy was. This was because, with Rockstar, I'd get a quick burst of energy, but that usually didn't last too long. Most times, by the end of the day, I crashed. However, Aura seems to give pretty steady energy, lasting for hours without making me jittery or wired. I think the nootropic blend makes a huge difference-ingredients such as Cognizin citicoline and theanine. I have a lot more energy, but also feel really focused and clear-headed, which wasn't the case with Rockstar. Of course, another big plus about Aura over Rockstar would be that it contains no sugar at all. Rockstar is a drink loaded with sugar, and although this may give me an immediate boost of energy, it could often make me feel a bit sluggish later on. Aura is sugar-free and made from clean, natural ingredients, so I don't have to be as concerned about crashing or feel guilty about what I'm taking. Plus, the sour gummy flavor is amazing, way more enjoyable than any Rockstar flavor I've tried. I grabbed mine here https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF35MFQP Aura is also a lot more convenient. With Rockstar, I always had to carry around a can and make sure to drink it before it got warm. But Aura pouches are small, easy to carry, and require no preparation whatsoever. I can pop a pouch in my mouth anytime I need an energy boost, at work, at the gym, or running errands; it's just so much more practical for my busy lifestyle. I still think Rockstar is not bad, but that's especially if you want just a quick shot of energy. However, Aura has become a much better choice for me: the energy is longer, cleaner, and it helps me stay focused without the side effects I used to get from drinking Rockstar. If you want more than your usual, ordinary energy drink, I strongly recommend trying the Aura pouches-you won't regret it! Read more | 5.0\nRockstar is the best energy drink. They have a variety of good flavors ( fruit punch is the best). 250 mg of caffeine is the perfect amount for me to sustain throughout the day. Highly recommend it. Read more | 5.0\nTastes good if you like apple. Sorta close to a green apply jolly rancher. It is very sweet so just keep that in mind if you don't prefer sweet drinks! Read more | 5.0\nI enjoyed this flavor...it is a bit clingy and doesn't pair well with meals, IMO...nice \"desert drink\" with a bit of a kick. Read more | 4.0\nI recently tried the Rockstar Punched Energy Drink in the Fruit Punch flavor, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in both taste and value. I purchased the 16oz cans in a convenient 12-pack, and it has quickly become my go-to energy boost. The Fruit Punch flavor is incredibly refreshing, striking the perfect balance between sweetness and a tangy kick. Unlike some other energy drinks, Rockstar Punched doesn't have an overpowering artificial taste – it's just the right amount of flavor to invigorate your senses. What sets this energy drink apart is not just its taste but also its affordability. The 12-pack is priced competitively, making it an excellent value for the quality you get. I appreciate that I can enjoy a delicious energy boost without breaking the bank. The 16oz cans are also a great size, providing enough energy to power through my day without the need for constant refills. Whether I'm tackling a workout or just need a pick-me-up during a busy afternoon, Rockstar Punched has become my reliable companion. In conclusion, if you're looking for an energy drink that delivers on taste, quality, and affordability, Rockstar Punched in the Fruit Punch flavor is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing and invigorating experience without compromising on their budget. Read more | 5.0\nI love, love, love this flavor. In my opinion it's the tastiest energy drink to be had. I mean, it's green apple and it tastes like it. What's not to like?

Read more | 5.0\nThis has been a particular favorite between my wife, teenage daughter, and I for a while.  We ended up getting it from Amazon since a lot of local places around us stopped carrying it. It taste more like a fruity drink over an energy drink, and is really nice and tasty when you have it closer to frozen temperature wise.  Very easy to go down and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste.  It is a little syrupy sweet, but nothing strong like Mountain Dew.  We actually prefer this one to the whipped orange, which sadly doesn't hit the nostalgia of a creamsicle bar as I was hoping it would. When we first had this on Subscribe and Save it was $15.99 for a pack of 12, so the prices seem to roughly close to the same.  The value is buying it in bulk, as an individual one of these is $2.49 at our local Kroger, so you are pretty much paying a little over less than a dollar each, which for 12 cans is pretty significant. Read more | 5.0\nDon't get me wrong, I bought this purely to support RockStar energy (I also bought the OG throwback to compare) but the OG flavor was truly better. I remember back In the days (when Rockstar was the first energy drink in the USA) that was my go to. Over Redbull, monster, Nos etc. Then they changed the \"formula\" to what is now called \"original\" and honestly I have no idea why. That made me stop drinking Rockstar for so long, I ended up converting to a NoS drinker then a Monster energy drinker. Thankfully they brought back the OG flavor with the \"throwback\" version and all I can say is KEEP THAT VERSION PERMANENTLY! They really are different and where I'm honestly just too old to vividly remember the \"taste\" of the actual OG Rockstar (to like, compare it to this \"throwback\" version) and I'm not LA beast over there drinking outdated \"vintage\" products just to \"remember\" them lol. I can definitely say that the OG one definitely reminded me of the OG flavor (hence it's name) and it definitely is a different taste than the \"now original\" flavor. So 4/5 I still support RockStar, it was the first energy drink I even fell in love with and picked over all the rest but I just don't agree with the \"change\", hence my 4/5. 5/5 for the OG flavor. Get throw back OG version, Rockstar, keep that version permanent, that's how you get OG fans back to being loyal to your drink over the rest. Facts. I'll be buying plenty more OG Throwback versions. No \"hate\" on the \"original\" i just don't person get the \"change\". I personally prefer/ed the OG flavor. Read more | 4.0\nI love the rock star energy drinks. I love the red one, and this one the gold. They taste good, and they really do give you a good energy. I would have posted a picture of them, but I drank them so quick. I couldn't take a picture. They're all gone, I'll have to order more. Read more | 5.0\nGlad that I'm able to buy this flavor of Rockstar on Amazon because I'm not able to find it locally anymore. The price per can is on par with what it would cost at a local grocery store or gas station. Read more | 5.0\nI love the taste and energy boost from Rockstar Sugar Free—it's a fantastic drink that keeps me going throughout the day. The sleek 12oz cans are the perfect size, and the 8-pack is super convenient. However, the packaging could use some improvement. The plastic wrapping around the pack was damaged when it arrived, which made me a bit concerned about the cans inside. Fortunately, they were intact, but better care during packing or shipping would make for a better overall experience. Still, the drink itself is excellent, so I’m giving it 4 stars. Just a little extra attention to packaging would make it perfect! Read more | 4.0"

Read more | 4.0\nEver since I discovered these energy drinks, they have become a part of every morning. I don’t feel that I need to have one, like coffee, or other stimulant type of caffeine drink. I just like the taste, and the way that it energizes and starts my morning. One issue to be aware of of course is the fact that five hour energy does contain niacin. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just important to note that you should not drink the entire bottle all at once, particularly if you have had any type of low blood blood pressure problem  in the past, or you are taking medication for blood pressure. The niacin may cause a niacin rush as it is known and this may make you feel a little faint. Some people have actually reported that they drank the entire bottle and then fainted for a moment onto the floor.  The bottle itself warns against this and does indicate that you should not drink the entire bottle all at once. For me, I break it up into three parts I take a drink and then perhaps get dressed or take a shower then I drink another third, and perhaps read the daily newspaper  or answer email and then by the time I get into the car after about 30 or 40 minutes I drink the final third of the bottle. That is perfect for me no effects no dizziness and I am fully energized for the morning some of the flavors are not real wonderful, so choose the one that you like the best. For me it is the berry. I don’t particularly care for the watermelon. Read more | 5.0\nMy husband prefers 5 hour energies over a cup of coffee, especially when he is traveling long distance.  He has really no favorites and seems to like all the flavors.  He does really like this flavor - peach mango and tends to pick this one up more.  The multi pack is definitely a cheaper option than buying them one at  a time. Read more | 5.0\nMy morning caffeine comes from coffee, but my midday and afternoon boost comes from these 5 Hour Energy shots. I like the taste and the non jittery boost these give when the afternoon yawns start. I subscribed for monthly delivery because of the price and because my preferred variety (Berry flavored, Regular strength) is often unavailable at my local stores. So far my deliveries have arrived when scheduled. I will keep my subscription Read more | 5.0"

    "reviews": "Just finished a workout and feeling drained? Craving that sweet, lemony goodness, but also need a little pick-me-up? Look no further than Rockstar Recovery Lemonade! This isn't your average energy drink. It ditches the fizz for a smooth, lemonade taste and packs a punch with caffeine, electrolytes, and B vitamins. Think of it as a post-workout reward that also gives you a little extra oomph. Tastes great: Seriously, it's like sunshine in a can. No fizz: Perfect if you're not a fan of the bubbly stuff. Electrolytes: Helps you rehydrate after sweating it out. B vitamins: May give you a little extra pep in your step. Sugar-free: Bonus points for those watching their sugar intake. But before you go chugging a whole case, keep this in mind: The \"shock\" comes from the caffeine: 160mg is a lot, so be mindful of jitters and avoid downing them like soda. Artificial sweeteners: Not everyone's a fan, and there's some debate about their health effects. It's not magic: A healthy diet and exercise are still your best bet for long-lasting energy. Overall, Rockstar Recovery Lemonade is a decent choice for an occasional pick-me-up, especially after exercise. Read more | 5.0\nNice low carb sugar option without weird aftertaste.

It has slightly less caffeine than other options which is also good for those that don’t want to be overly caffeinated or jittery and I enjoy that it isn’t carbonated or as much of the typical energy drink fruity flavors that can be a bit sickening to me at times.  Price is steadily increasing so value is dependent on timing but otherwise these are my tried and true drink in the morning. Read more | 5.0\nThese are great.

Read more | 5.0\nThis has been a particular favorite between my wife, teenage daughter, and I for a while.  We ended up getting it from Amazon since a lot of local places around us stopped carrying it. It taste more like a fruity drink over an energy drink, and is really nice and tasty when you have it closer to frozen temperature wise.  Very easy to go down and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste.  It is a little syrupy sweet, but nothing strong like Mountain Dew.  We actually prefer this one to the whipped orange, which sadly doesn't hit the nostalgia of a creamsicle bar as I was hoping it would. When we first had this on Subscribe and Save it was $15.99 for a pack of 12, so the prices seem to roughly close to the same.  The value is buying it in bulk, as an individual one of these is $2.49 at our local Kroger, so you are pretty much paying a little over less than a dollar each, which for 12 cans is pretty significant.

I remember back In the days (when Rockstar was the first energy drink in the USA) that was my go to. Over Redbull, monster, Nos etc. Then they changed the \"formula\" to what is now called \"original\" and honestly I have no idea why. That made me stop drinking Rockstar for so long, I ended up converting to a NoS drinker then a Monster energy drinker. Thankfully they brought back the OG flavor with the \"throwback\" version and all I can say is KEEP THAT VERSION PERMANENTLY!

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

    "reviews": "Watermelon Strawberry Peach Fruit Punch Berry Sangria Hardcore Apple Always great, its really the only flavor I prefer. Love Rockstar! Tastes great, great quality. Always helps me get going in the morning with the caffeine. Priced well below the stores. Read more | 5.0\nI have been drinking Rockstar Punched energy for years. It has always been my favorite energy drink to make it through those extra-long shifts at work or power through tough workouts. The flavor is bold, and yeah, it definitely gives a strong energy kick if that's what I need. It had just about everything one could want: a bunch of caffeine and a load of sugar, too, which always really gave me that immediate kick. But as much as I've enjoyed rockstar over the years, recently I tried Aura caffeine pouches, and man, they're so much better. The first thing I noticed about Aura is how smooth and long-lasting the energy was. This was because, with Rockstar, I'd get a quick burst of energy, but that usually didn't last too long. Most times, by the end of the day, I crashed. However, Aura seems to give pretty steady energy, lasting for hours without making me jittery or wired. I think the nootropic blend makes a huge difference-ingredients such as Cognizin citicoline and theanine. I have a lot more energy, but also feel really focused and clear-headed, which wasn't the case with Rockstar. Of course, another big plus about Aura over Rockstar would be that it contains no sugar at all. Rockstar is a drink loaded with sugar, and although this may give me an immediate boost of energy, it could often make me feel a bit sluggish later on. Aura is sugar-free and made from clean, natural ingredients, so I don't have to be as concerned about crashing or feel guilty about what I'm taking. Plus, the sour gummy flavor is amazing, way more enjoyable than any Rockstar flavor I've tried. I grabbed mine here https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF35MFQP Aura is also a lot more convenient. With Rockstar, I always had to carry around a can and make sure to drink it before it got warm. But Aura pouches are small, easy to carry, and require no preparation whatsoever. I can pop a pouch in my mouth anytime I need an energy boost, at work, at the gym, or running errands; it's just so much more practical for my busy lifestyle. I still think Rockstar is not bad, but that's especially if you want just a quick shot of energy. However, Aura has become a much better choice for me: the energy is longer, cleaner, and it helps me stay focused without the side effects I used to get from drinking Rockstar. If you want more than your usual, ordinary energy drink, I strongly recommend trying the Aura pouches-you won't regret it! Read more | 5.0\nRockstar is the best energy drink. They have a variety of good flavors ( fruit punch is the best). 250 mg of caffeine is the perfect amount for me to sustain throughout the day. Highly recommend it. Read more | 5.0\nTastes good if you like apple. Sorta close to a green apply jolly rancher. It is very sweet so just keep that in mind if you don't prefer sweet drinks! Read more | 5.0\nI enjoyed this flavor...it is a bit clingy and doesn't pair well with meals, IMO...nice \"desert drink\" with a bit of a kick. Read more | 4.0\nI recently tried the Rockstar Punched Energy Drink in the Fruit Punch flavor, and I must say, it exceeded my expectations in both taste and value. I purchased the 16oz cans in a convenient 12-pack, and it has quickly become my go-to energy boost. The Fruit Punch flavor is incredibly refreshing, striking the perfect balance between sweetness and a tangy kick. Unlike some other energy drinks, Rockstar Punched doesn't have an overpowering artificial taste – it's just the right amount of flavor to invigorate your senses. What sets this energy drink apart is not just its taste but also its affordability. The 12-pack is priced competitively, making it an excellent value for the quality you get. I appreciate that I can enjoy a delicious energy boost without breaking the bank. The 16oz cans are also a great size, providing enough energy to power through my day without the need for constant refills. Whether I'm tackling a workout or just need a pick-me-up during a busy afternoon, Rockstar Punched has become my reliable companion. In conclusion, if you're looking for an energy drink that delivers on taste, quality, and affordability, Rockstar Punched in the Fruit Punch flavor is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing and invigorating experience without compromising on their budget. Read more | 5.0\nI love, love, love this flavor. In my opinion it's the tastiest energy drink to be had. I mean, it's green apple and it tastes like it. What's not to like? Only better thing would be if Rockstar would make a pear flavor. 😉 Read more | 5.0\nIf you're hard core like this can chug this thing down in the morning, you'll be on a Sugar Rush from hell. I absolutely love this drink. Read more | 5.0\n5.0"

    "reviews": "Watermelon Sour Apple Pink Lemonade Mango Passionfruit Lemon Lime Iced Tea - Lemonade Coconut/Pineapple Cherry Vanilla Blue Raspberry Afterburner Orange I’ve tried every energy drink on the market, but Jocko GO is like finding an oasis in a desert of sugar-laden, jitter-inducing cans. It’s the energy drink equivalent of a Zen garden – it boosts your energy without sending you into orbit. Flavor: The Iced Tea - Lemonade flavor is a match made in heaven, like peanut butter and jelly or socks and sandals. It’s the Arnold Palmer of energy drinks, and it’s got a kick that could wake up a hibernating bear. Keto-Friendly: As someone who’s been on the Keto train longer than I’ve been doing bicep curls, I appreciate that Jocko GO doesn’t mess with my macros. It’s as Keto-friendly as a drink can get, and it doesn’t have that weird aftertaste that some Keto products do. Vitamins & Electrolytes: This drink doesn’t just wake up your brain; it gives your body a high-five. With Vitamin B12, B6, and a squad of electrolytes, it’s like a multivitamin in a canAd1. Plus, the L Theanine ensures you’re energized without feeling like you’ve got ants in your pants. All-Natural: No artificial sweeteners here! It’s sweetened with monk fruit, which I’m pretty sure is what monks use to stay awake during those long meditationsAd1. And it’s all-natural, so you can feel like a health guru while chugging it down. Conclusion: Jocko GO is the Chuck Norris of energy drinks – tough, no-nonsense, and it doesn’t need caffeine to be powerful. It’s the perfect sidekick for your daily grind or your workout routine. Just don’t be surprised if you find yourself doing push-ups at 3 AM because you’ve got energy to burn. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the Jocko GO Energy Drink, and I am thoroughly impressed. Here’s a detailed breakdown of my experience: Flavor and Taste: I tried the blue raspberry flavor, and it was a delightful surprise. The taste is smooth and refreshing without being overly sweet or artificial. It has a subtle, natural fruitiness that makes it enjoyable to drink. Energy and Performance: What sets Jocko GO apart from other energy drinks is its clean energy boost. I felt a significant increase in my energy levels and mental focus within 15-20 minutes of drinking it. The best part? There was no jittery feeling or crash afterward, which is common with many other energy drinks. Ingredients: The ingredient list is impressive, focusing on clean and healthy components. It contains no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and is packed with nootropics and adaptogens. Knowing that it’s keto-friendly and free from artificial additives gives me peace of mind that I’m consuming a healthier alternative. Packaging: The packaging is sleek and appealing. The cans are easy to open, and the size is perfect for on-the-go consumption. The branding aligns well with the product’s promise of providing a disciplined energy boost. Value for Money: Considering the quality of ingredients and the effectiveness of the drink, I find it to be reasonably priced. It’s a great value for anyone looking to enhance their energy and focus without compromising their health. Overall, Jocko GO Energy Drink has exceeded my expectations. It provides a clean and effective energy boost, tastes great, and is made with high-quality ingredients. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable energy drink that supports a healthy lifestyle. Read more | 5.0\nRevised review: so I have no problem giving this product 5 stars now,  I spoke directly to the jocko fuel company and they stated there was some sort of misprint and they relabeled the energy drinks with the CORRECT labels so the plastic label you can peel is the correct label of flavor you are getting you can confirm this by looking at the bottom of the can and checking the lot number, for example if you have mango mayhem you will see a JMM, if you have watermelon assault you will see JWA…. So that solved the wrapping issue whatever flavor you choose is the correct flavor you are getting and that is how you can double check. My next question was the “plastic” ppl kept writing about. They confirmed it 100% is NOT plastic when you put your jocko drinks in the freezer or cold fridge for a while calcium salt buildup occurs the jocko company confirmed they had looked into everyone’s complaints and had tested it themselves and that’s what it was the rep also stated that if you rub the salt buildup between your fingers it does eventually dissolve and it’s 100% safe to drink these lil bits of calcium salt buildup pieces. Knowing all of this now I feel great about giving this drink 5 stars I hope ppl read my review and don’t jump just to the negative ones who didn’t bother digging just a lil bit to get answers, I truly believe this is one of the healthiest energy drinks out there and as someone who has a high risk of cancer I have to be careful and more aware of all the toxic crap out there I love that they use monkfruit it has anti cancer properties and for that I don’t mind the aftertaste that ppl seem to dislike about these drinks I love there’s no preservatives which I’m assuming causes the calcium salt buildup and why other unhealthyer options don’t have this problem because they are loaded with preservatives. Caffeine is my only vice so if I can find the healthiest way to continue my addiction and not increase my cancer risk I’m very happy about that thank you jocko for putting out a healthier option for us all. Old review: So I like the flavors, yes it is sweet but I also used to drink bangs and those are pretty sweet. I like the ingredients in these, I also used to drink Celsius but found those actually are not very good for you either and that’s how I ended up finding these. My ONE big complaint about them is they clearly had some sort of packaging issue and now ppl are getting the wrong flavors if you peel the label off underneath is the actual drink you are getting! I ordered the savage flavor and the watermelon flavor. What I got was the tropic thunder flavor with the savage label cover and then weirdly enough I actually got the savage flavor but with a watermelon label :/ luckily I like the pineapple coconut otherwise my review would be a lil more annoyed…. I would like to contact someone so I can get watermelon and I’m not going to order anymore until they guarantee I’m gonna get the right flavors! But if someone contacts me and explains what happened and that they are fixing the problem so I can get the correct flavors then I have no problem giving this drink a 5 star because I actually really like them Read more | 5.0"

    "bullet_points": "About this item    THE MOST EFFICACIOUS ENERGY DRINK (Over 2000 mg of Nootropics) - Most energy drinks provide nothing more than a jolt of caffeine and a smattering of antioxidants. This approach didn’t address the growing demand for true cognitive support and left much to be desired. Gorilla Mind Energy features an incomparable active ingredient profile designed not only to deliver CNS stimulation but also to push the dopaminergic, serotonergic and cholinergic pathways harder than any energy drink has to date.    COMPLETELY UNIQUE & POTENT ACTIVE INGREDIENT PROFILE - Our ‘Energy Matrix’ produces a distinct amplified focus, unmatched energy, elevated mental clarity, and clearly feels more potent than other energy drinks on the market. Gorilla Mind Energy is the perfect synergy of taste and efficacy.    17 DELICIOUS FLAVORS - Equally as disappointing as the outdated formulations in this industry is the taste of the typical ‘go to’ energy drink. Consumer palates have become far more refined over the past decade, and the bar has been raised for what will stand out in this absurdly saturated market. This is where we take it home. We are VERY confident when we say that all of our flavors will hang with, or beat, any of the big boys in this industry while providing a far more effective formula.    NO SUGAR OR ARTIFICIAL COLORS - Every single one of our energy drink flavors is sugar-free, does not feature any artificial colors, and is as close to calorie-free as possible.    THIRD-PARTY TESTED - This is a premium formula with premium ingredients. Commensurate with that, we employ third-party testing of not just our powder and capsule formulas but also our energy drinks to constantly oversee the purity of our products.    \n   See more product details",

    "reviews": "Tropic Wave Tigers Blood Strawberry Candy Sour Watermelon Candy Orange Rush Orange Ice Dream Mango Peach Lychee Bomb Lucky Lemon Exotic Kiwi Bombsicle Blackberry Lemonade Black Cherry Vanilla Berry Burst Arctic White Variety Pack #2 Variety Pack #1 Wild Grape Going to break this up a bit. Tl:dr, tastes great, works well, price is fine, packaging sucks a bit. Taste: So far I've tried Black Cherry Vanilla and Kiwi. Both are really tasty, but I have a preference for Black Cherry Vanilla. These don't taste like low calorie energy drinks, and not much like energy drinks at all. You don't get that annoying, acidic and metallic taste that many energy drinks have. Instead it's smooth, tastes as advertised, and has no weird aftertaste. If there was a decaf I would drink it for the taste alone. Efficacy: Different people react differently to supplements. With that out of the way, the dosages are well within the \"effective\" range and I haven't found a nootropic on the market with these dosages combined. Derek has a video nearly an hour and a half long on YouTube breaking down the active ingredients, what they do, and studies that back their efficacy. Personally and anecdotally, wowza. The caffeine level is akin to a normal energy drink so you get the initial hit, but no jitters. Then the nootropics kick in (then take 30 min to an hour on average for most people). Focus is insane, word recall is noticable, and mood is enhanced. I got more used to it after a while, but the first day I cleaned most of my house because I was so hyped. At this point, I can't imagine a day without one. I know for the sake of my wallet I should slow down, but I love how both energizing and calming the drink is at the same time. Cost: It's not the cheapest. That said, it is way cheaper than Starbucks or any coffee shop. I often go to my local coffee shop to get work done, but that ends up costing me like $6-7 (with tip) per day for an iced coffee or iced black eye. I would sometimes pop by the corner store to get a Monster for the weekend or something. That was $3, which is cheaper than redbull. If you do the math, as of now Gorilla Mind energy comes out to around $3 a can, and is way higher quality then redbull. So, I'm saving money if I don't go to the coffee shop and breaking even with Monster. Packaging: There are plenty of pictures of cans being damaged and it's true. A few of mine arrived damage, and the quality of the materials on the cans isn't the best. That said, it's so good that I'm not deducting a star. Really a game changer, I recommend giving it a go. If you are unsure, watch Derek's video on YouTube. Read more | 5.0\nI accidentally tried one for free in my work office and immediately have to order a full pack of this from Amazon, I was so impressed by all the active ingredient and efficacy of it. 100% recommend to everyone who want a daily brain boost to replace daily Coffee/Caffeine. Most energy drinks out there are just lots of Sugar and Caffeine, while this one contains all the core Active Ingredient for mind clarity that I regularly take in Pills format, so I don't have to shove in 5-6 pills a day on top of my daily supplements anymore thanks to this. I wish its more widely available in all other Asia countries when I travel. The only downside for me is that the drink is Carbonated which give me mild stomach bloat and gas issue (still less issues than all the other Soda brands), and the Caffeine content is a bit too high for me (200 mg), I usually take 1-2 Caffeine Gums a day (with 50 mg of Caffeine per pill), and 200 mg is a bit too strong for me since I'm very sensitive to Caffeine. Arctic White Flavor taste really good though, just like Sprite with no sugar, now I can fully replaced my daily Coke Zero can with this one. Read more | 5.0\nGreat taste, energy and focus! Love Gorilla Mind products! Read more | 5.0\nI have had two cases previously purchased. The first case was Orange and the flavor was amazing and had no damage. The second case, that was damaged. Not to the point of it needing to be returned but about 25% of the product needed to be opened with tools due to damage sustained in shipping. With the product being amazing I again ordered more but the last two shipments have been damaged to the point Amazon has labeled to be non-deliverable. While it is nice to not have to go through a claim process it is highly frustrating to have two separate orders marked as undeliverable, a refund automated, no new order being immediately processed, and this is already on top of the abnormally longer shipment time for these beverages. I love Gorilla Mind, their products, and their services, it is sadly just apparent there is a disconnect between GM and Amazon as the product can't even arrive to its final destination without being damaged or destroyed. I will give it one more chance before trying to find an alternative option. Read more | 1.0\nNot my favorite flavor but good nonetheless. These drinks keep me focused and alert for work. By far the best energy drink on the market as far as physical and cognitive impact, and taste. Also, this is one of the few energy drinks that uses methycobalimin, along with other excellent vitamins, specifically vitamin C. Read more | 4.0\n5.0"

If you love gfuel buy this gfuel. I love it. All jokes aside the flavor is pretty good, It's a sweet but just right type of flavor.

I have trouble finding these around me and saw a good sale for them on Amazon.  Buying a case of them comes out to a better price than individually at the store by at least a dollar.  So that is a great value. What I didn’t like is while they are shipped shrink wrapped as shown in the product listing photos, they came in an additional amazon box but when I opened them the cans are all dented.  They are dented in places you wouldn’t expect as well.  There was no leaking and nothing ruptured, just oddly dented cans.

I had to go to the G Fuel site itself in order to figure out what this is.  Apparently, it's supposed to be \"rainbow candy\" flavor. It is a candy flavor, but it's strange.  If I think \"rainbow candy\" I think of things like Skittles, Starburst, or Life Savers or something like that.  It's not close to any of those to me anyway, instead it's this weird artificial candy flavor, as odd as that sounds.  Perhaps an artificial fruit flavor(s) mixed with a hint of coconut?  It's hard to describe and not what I expected. It's not so terrible that I can't drink it---I hate wasting stuff---but I would not buy this again.

This drink is a game-changer for anyone looking for a delicious, energizing pick-me-up. With 92mg of caffeine, it gives me the perfect boost to power through my day. Plus, it's packed with vitamins B & C, which adds a nice health benefit to my favorite drink. One of the best things about Mountain Dew Kickstart is its lower sugar content compared to other energy drinks. At only 80 calories and 5% juice, it's a lighter option that doesn't compromise on flavor. The refreshing citrus taste is absolutely fantastic—it's like a burst of sunshine in every sip!

Read more | 5.0\nPlease stop packaging them this way!! I adore this flavor and drink. It is my morning “coffee.” I’ve had two whole orders (2 twelve packs in each order) have to be cancelled and returned because they busted in transit. Now, I have an order with a bunch of the cans deformed from smashing around… aka they were 🤏🏻this close to busting also. All of this has just been since they’ve been sent together in a huge box in their new shrink wrapped packaging. The box they’re being shipped in is too big, so they jostle around and smash together. But what I really don’t get is why Mountain Dew changed the packaging??? The cardboard boxes that had each drink in its own cardboard compartment were perfect. Kickstarts have always been known to bust, so the better protection made sense and worked. I get it costs more, so charge a little more or something! I literally buy this flavor in bulk on Amazon because it’s hard to find, and it’s by far my favorite. If I have any of the red flavors for more than a couple days in a row, the red dye gives me migraines. And this flavor has (if I’m not mistaken) the most actual juice content of the flavors. It’s absolutely my go to. Every. Day. It’s not too much caffeine, and it makes me feel GOOD! My entire family swears by “Yellows” as we call them. 😂 We’ve been known to walk in a Dollar General and holler out, “They have Yellows! Get a buggy!” To which the cashier said, “Oh! I wondered what you were talking about,” as they checked out our 20 Pineapple Orange Mango Kickstarts one by one. 🙈😅 I would love to change my review to 5 stars… if you fix the packaging issues. 🙏🏻 Read more | 4.0\nReally tasty jolt that is not always easy to find.

They're cheaper than sodas, too. At the current price, each can is between $1.50 and $2. That's also cheaper than coffee at many coffee shops and convenience stores. I don't get tired of them. The cans are often delivered well. I've had one instance of significant bending to the can rim this entire time, but the integrity of the contents was maintained. I'll definitely keep buying.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Bundle C4 Smart Energy Official Variety Pack Watermelon Burst Tropical Passion-fruit Tropical Oasis Variety Pack Strawberry Guava Cherry Berry Lime Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Yuzu Black Cherry Berry Breeze Variety Pack C4 Brain & Body Official Variety Pack Peach Mango Nectar The media could not be loaded. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost. I still prefer Rockstar or Monster overall. Read more | 4.0\nCellucor is the best energy drink on the market.  The flavors are great, and just the right amount of energy.

    "reviews": "Orange Cream Mixed Tray Blueberry Tart VALR Energy has quickly become my favorite energy drink! The flavor is perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and it gives me hours of smooth, focused energy without the jitters or dreaded crash. Knowing it’s made with natural ingredients makes it an easy, guilt-free choice for staying energized throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the two flavor pack with Orange Cream and Blueberry Tart. Orange Cream was my personal favorite out of the 2. As someone that is picky with energy drinks, I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. Neither had that fake energy drink taste that some of the other brands on the market have. The were tasty but not too sweet. The caffeine content was perfect to give you mental focus but none of the weird jittery feeling. I felt focused and awake all day without any crash also! The nitrogen gives the drinks a little bit of carbonation without being overpowering. As someone that also prioritizes their health, I really like that this brand has clean ingredients and is more geared toward a healthy lifestyle. 10/10 would buy again and recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using VALR Nitrogen Infused energy drinks for a few weeks now, and I’m impressed with the boost they provide without the usual jitters. As an active mother, I need something that helps with both focus and stamina during my workouts, and this does the trick. The smooth, refreshing taste makes it easy to enjoy, and I love that it doesn’t leave me feeling drained later on. Overall, it’s a great energy drink that supports my busy lifestyle Read more | 5.0\nI’m usually pretty hesitant to try most energy drinks because they make me jittery and often taste like chemicals, but I decided to try VALR because of the green tea extract and nitrogenation.. and this is actually delicious! The nitrogen makes the liquid feel thicker/gives the satisfaction of carbonation, without the actual bubbles or gas aftermath.  I got the variety pack to try both flavors- the orange reminded me of an orange and cream sorbet, and the blueberry (my fav) literally just tasted like blueberry green tea. I have the mental and physical energy, without feeling anxious or shaky. Definitely recommend at least giving them a try!! Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who's pretty sensitive to caffeine, this was a nice mid-day pick me up and I could feel my alertness level rise after drinking less than half the can, no jitters. The sweetness level works for me (I like sweet drinks) and the fact that it's infused with nitrogen makes for a really smooth texture that felt like a treat. I'm going to start having one before my workout classes. Orange is my fav - will continue to repurchase! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of an energy drink consumer because most of the drinks on the market have way too much caffeine! The can only has 175mg of caffeine through green tea. I did not experience any weird jitters or crashes after drinking the entire can. The other things I love about the product is its focus on natural juices and flavoring as well as it being nitrogenated. I was also able to drink an entire can before a workout with no bloat that you would typically get from a carbonated drink making my workout comfortable. This is a great product! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been searching for a clean, effective energy drink, and VALR is now my go-to. The taste is refreshing and not overly sweet, which I love. It provides a steady energy boost that keeps me focused for hours without the jittery feeling or crash I’ve experienced with other brands. Plus, it’s packed with natural ingredients, which makes me feel good about drinking it. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nVALR is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the orange, but the blueberry is also super satisfying. I was expecting carbonation like other energy drinks, but the nitrogenated texture was a pleasant surprise. It’s a bit thicker but without the carbonation, so no burping side effects! I’m focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough protein while leading a healthy lifestyle. One thing I love about Valr is that it mixes perfectly with my clear protein powder for a refreshing, energizing boost. It’s delicious on its own and even better with protein. I can’t say enough great things about this energy drink! The energy boost from Valr is different from other drinks. It doesn’t give me a big spike and then a crash. Instead, it provides a natural, lasting boost that maximizes my focus, energy levels, and attentiveness, making it a great companion for my workday mornings. I’m a die-hard fan of the orange flavor and can’t wait to start all my days with it. I’ll be ordering another case soon! I would love to try other flavors as they come out with new ones!

It's tasty, gives me steady energy, and keeps me feeling good even after my workout. If you're looking for something to help you power through your gym sessions without the crash, I definitely recommend giving this a try! Extended explanation: I've been trying out the drink for a month now, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for my workouts! I'm not an expert, but I do try different pre workout drinks and I know what makes me feel good, and this drink definitely does the trick. **Taste and Flavor** First off, the Guava Paradise flavor is delicious! When this went on sale, I only bought two cans because I typically dislike the flavor of guava drinks. This one, however, is not like that it is so perfect. It's got this perfect mix of sweet and tart that makes it super refreshing. Plus, it's not too fizzy, so it doesn't leave me feeling bloated. **Energy Boost** What I love most about this drink is the energy boost it gives me. I feel more awake and ready to tackle my workout without feeling jittery. The energy comes on smoothly and lasts throughout my session, which is awesome because I hate that crash you get with some other energy drinks. **No Crash** Speaking of crashes, there's none with this one! I can go through my entire workout and still feel good afterward. It's great for those days when I need a little extra push but don't want to feel wiped out later. Read more | 5.0\nThese are delicious. There’s a strong green apple flavor, but it’s not overly sour or difficult to drink. There’s a decent amount of caffeine in each can (180 mg in 12 fluid ounces) so they provide a good kick. Keep this flavor around! Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor was great at first but the aftertaste is something else. I'm not a fan but you might be. Either way I can't return it.. bummer. Read more | 4.0\nThese are disgusting. I was hoping they’d taste “citrusy” like the Ecto Cooler from the 80s. Boy was I wrong. Not even a hint of good flavor. It smells and tastes like Flintstones Vitamins. Picked up 3 different Ghostbusters themed flavors for the Buy 2 Get 1 Free deal. Now I have 11 more of these in the case to try and drink. Not sure if that’s gonna work out. Pass on these. Read more | 1.0\nThey stink when you open them! Smells so bad. But I like the taste. It's like a lime flavor to me. Read more | 3.0\nI recently started using Oxyshred Proton Plasma, and it has truly transformed my mornings. This supplement provides a smooth, long-lasting energy boost without the jitters, keeping me focused and productive throughout the day. Its formula supports weight management by enhancing metabolism, which has made my workouts more effective. I've noticed improvements in both endurance and recovery as a result. The delicious flavor options are an added bonus, making it easy to mix with water or smoothies. Overall, Oxyshred Proton Plasma is a game-changer that elevates my daily performance and supports my fitness goals. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love this drink. I order this so much. Grape, Cali Cola and Tangerine Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been trying out different energy drinks, this one is not one of my favorites.  It’s not terrible but this is not one of the better ones on the market in my opinion. - It’s advertised as not jittery energy, but it feels very jittery to me. I feel shaky, less focused, not more. Almost anxious. I don’t know why. - it’s very acidic, and can be tough on your stomach.  Lifting weights with a stomachache is actually detrimental in the gym, makes your workout worse, not better. - I got the Guava flavor, I don’t expect energy drinks to be delicious and maybe the other flavors are better, but this one tastes like Guava flavored gasoline.  Bangs flavors don’t have that yuck effect, it’s hard to want to finish a whole can of this product even though it’s only 12 oz. For ‘moderate’ caffeine, I’d rather drink a rehab iced tea by monster, not carbonated, no stomachache, tastes good, and provides some hydration with a good energy level that doesn’t leave you feeling strung out like a speed addict when it wears off. For maximum energy hit when you really need to get crazy in the gym and don’t give a crap about anything else, nothing I’ve tried so far beats a full bottle of Redline.  Can’t be healthy for you but it’s the most powerful I’ve tried and it’s 3 gulps, no carbonation, and you’re ready to throw a fit with the weights.  Just don’t take it late in the day, you’ll regret it. I gave Oxyshred a try, won’t be ordering it again. Read more | 2.0\n2.0"

First, the flavors: 10/10 I got the variety pack to try out different flavors. My favorites are raspberry and black cherry so far. They are so tasty with no sugar free aftertaste whatsoever. Next, the fizz: 9/10 The fizz is very mild, not overbearing. Not as fizzy as a seltzer, just a fine, enjoyable texture on the tongue. Lastly, the energy: 10/10!! Ok, I'm an RN and this is the important part for me. Most energy drinks are too caffeinated and make me feel like jittery garbage then a crash comes later. This is honestly the best kind of energy drink I've ever tried because it gave me a rush of bright, jitter-less energy that lasted from 7a to 3pm, then i had a second one and it had the same effect, getting me through the rest of the shift. No crash, no headache, just a taper off of energy until i rebooted with the second one. I love this product and I'll be subscribing monthly so I never run out. So so good!!!

I got 50+ and my blood pressure was too high. Had to stop.  If your 20s and 30s party and have breakfast and these to wash down. Read more | 5.0\nThis has been a particular favorite between my wife, teenage daughter, and I for a while.  We ended up getting it from Amazon since a lot of local places around us stopped carrying it. It taste more like a fruity drink over an energy drink, and is really nice and tasty when you have it closer to frozen temperature wise.  Very easy to go down and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste.  It is a little syrupy sweet, but nothing strong like Mountain Dew.  We actually prefer this one to the whipped orange, which sadly doesn't hit the nostalgia of a creamsicle bar as I was hoping it would. When we first had this on Subscribe and Save it was $15.99 for a pack of 12, so the prices seem to roughly close to the same.  The value is buying it in bulk, as an individual one of these is $2.49 at our local Kroger, so you are pretty much paying a little over less than a dollar each, which for 12 cans is pretty significant. Read more | 5.0\nDon't get me wrong, I bought this purely to support RockStar energy (I also bought the OG throwback to compare) but the OG flavor was truly better. I remember back In the days (when Rockstar was the first energy drink in the USA) that was my go to. Over Redbull, monster, Nos etc. Then they changed the \"formula\" to what is now called \"original\" and honestly I have no idea why. That made me stop drinking Rockstar for so long, I ended up converting to a NoS drinker then a Monster energy drinker. Thankfully they brought back the OG flavor with the \"throwback\" version and all I can say is KEEP THAT VERSION PERMANENTLY! They really are different and where I'm honestly just too old to vividly remember the \"taste\" of the actual OG Rockstar (to like, compare it to this \"throwback\" version) and I'm not LA beast over there drinking outdated \"vintage\" products just to \"remember\" them lol. I can definitely say that the OG one definitely reminded me of the OG flavor (hence it's name) and it definitely is a different taste than the \"now original\" flavor. So 4/5 I still support RockStar, it was the first energy drink I even fell in love with and picked over all the rest but I just don't agree with the \"change\", hence my 4/5. 5/5 for the OG flavor. Get throw back OG version, Rockstar, keep that version permanent, that's how you get OG fans back to being loyal to your drink over the rest. Facts. I'll be buying plenty more OG Throwback versions. No \"hate\" on the \"original\" i just don't person get the \"change\". I personally prefer/ed the OG flavor. Read more | 4.0\nI love the rock star energy drinks. I love the red one, and this one the gold. They taste good, and they really do give you a good energy. I would have posted a picture of them, but I drank them so quick. I couldn't take a picture. They're all gone, I'll have to order more. Read more | 5.0\nGlad that I'm able to buy this flavor of Rockstar on Amazon because I'm not able to find it locally anymore. The price per can is on par with what it would cost at a local grocery store or gas station. Read more | 5.0\nI love the taste and energy boost from Rockstar Sugar Free—it's a fantastic drink that keeps me going throughout the day. The sleek 12oz cans are the perfect size, and the 8-pack is super convenient. However, the packaging could use some improvement. The plastic wrapping around the pack was damaged when it arrived, which made me a bit concerned about the cans inside. Fortunately, they were intact, but better care during packing or shipping would make for a better overall experience. Still, the drink itself is excellent, so I’m giving it 4 stars. Just a little extra attention to packaging would make it perfect! Read more | 4.0"

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to! The flavor is AMAZING! Energy is AMAZING! And it’s perfect for someone on keto looking for an energy boost! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n3.0\n5.0\n4.0"

The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals.

I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost. I still prefer Rockstar or Monster overall. Read more | 4.0\nCellucor is the best energy drink on the market.  The flavors are great, and just the right amount of energy.

    "reviews": "Watermelon Sour Apple Pink Lemonade Mango Passionfruit Lemon Lime Iced Tea - Lemonade Cherry Vanilla Blue Raspberry Afterburner Orange Coconut/Pineapple I’ve tried every energy drink on the market, but Jocko GO is like finding an oasis in a desert of sugar-laden, jitter-inducing cans. It’s the energy drink equivalent of a Zen garden – it boosts your energy without sending you into orbit. Flavor: The Iced Tea - Lemonade flavor is a match made in heaven, like peanut butter and jelly or socks and sandals. It’s the Arnold Palmer of energy drinks, and it’s got a kick that could wake up a hibernating bear. Keto-Friendly: As someone who’s been on the Keto train longer than I’ve been doing bicep curls, I appreciate that Jocko GO doesn’t mess with my macros. It’s as Keto-friendly as a drink can get, and it doesn’t have that weird aftertaste that some Keto products do. Vitamins & Electrolytes: This drink doesn’t just wake up your brain; it gives your body a high-five. With Vitamin B12, B6, and a squad of electrolytes, it’s like a multivitamin in a canAd1. Plus, the L Theanine ensures you’re energized without feeling like you’ve got ants in your pants. All-Natural: No artificial sweeteners here! It’s sweetened with monk fruit, which I’m pretty sure is what monks use to stay awake during those long meditationsAd1. And it’s all-natural, so you can feel like a health guru while chugging it down. Conclusion: Jocko GO is the Chuck Norris of energy drinks – tough, no-nonsense, and it doesn’t need caffeine to be powerful. It’s the perfect sidekick for your daily grind or your workout routine. Just don’t be surprised if you find yourself doing push-ups at 3 AM because you’ve got energy to burn. Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the Jocko GO Energy Drink, and I am thoroughly impressed. Here’s a detailed breakdown of my experience: Flavor and Taste: I tried the blue raspberry flavor, and it was a delightful surprise. The taste is smooth and refreshing without being overly sweet or artificial. It has a subtle, natural fruitiness that makes it enjoyable to drink. Energy and Performance: What sets Jocko GO apart from other energy drinks is its clean energy boost. I felt a significant increase in my energy levels and mental focus within 15-20 minutes of drinking it. The best part? There was no jittery feeling or crash afterward, which is common with many other energy drinks. Ingredients: The ingredient list is impressive, focusing on clean and healthy components. It contains no sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and is packed with nootropics and adaptogens. Knowing that it’s keto-friendly and free from artificial additives gives me peace of mind that I’m consuming a healthier alternative. Packaging: The packaging is sleek and appealing. The cans are easy to open, and the size is perfect for on-the-go consumption. The branding aligns well with the product’s promise of providing a disciplined energy boost. Value for Money: Considering the quality of ingredients and the effectiveness of the drink, I find it to be reasonably priced. It’s a great value for anyone looking to enhance their energy and focus without compromising their health. Overall, Jocko GO Energy Drink has exceeded my expectations. It provides a clean and effective energy boost, tastes great, and is made with high-quality ingredients. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable energy drink that supports a healthy lifestyle. Read more | 5.0\nRevised review: so I have no problem giving this product 5 stars now,  I spoke directly to the jocko fuel company and they stated there was some sort of misprint and they relabeled the energy drinks with the CORRECT labels so the plastic label you can peel is the correct label of flavor you are getting you can confirm this by looking at the bottom of the can and checking the lot number, for example if you have mango mayhem you will see a JMM, if you have watermelon assault you will see JWA…. So that solved the wrapping issue whatever flavor you choose is the correct flavor you are getting and that is how you can double check. My next question was the “plastic” ppl kept writing about. They confirmed it 100% is NOT plastic when you put your jocko drinks in the freezer or cold fridge for a while calcium salt buildup occurs the jocko company confirmed they had looked into everyone’s complaints and had tested it themselves and that’s what it was the rep also stated that if you rub the salt buildup between your fingers it does eventually dissolve and it’s 100% safe to drink these lil bits of calcium salt buildup pieces. Knowing all of this now I feel great about giving this drink 5 stars I hope ppl read my review and don’t jump just to the negative ones who didn’t bother digging just a lil bit to get answers, I truly believe this is one of the healthiest energy drinks out there and as someone who has a high risk of cancer I have to be careful and more aware of all the toxic crap out there I love that they use monkfruit it has anti cancer properties and for that I don’t mind the aftertaste that ppl seem to dislike about these drinks I love there’s no preservatives which I’m assuming causes the calcium salt buildup and why other unhealthyer options don’t have this problem because they are loaded with preservatives. Caffeine is my only vice so if I can find the healthiest way to continue my addiction and not increase my cancer risk I’m very happy about that thank you jocko for putting out a healthier option for us all. Old review: So I like the flavors, yes it is sweet but I also used to drink bangs and those are pretty sweet. I like the ingredients in these, I also used to drink Celsius but found those actually are not very good for you either and that’s how I ended up finding these. My ONE big complaint about them is they clearly had some sort of packaging issue and now ppl are getting the wrong flavors if you peel the label off underneath is the actual drink you are getting! I ordered the savage flavor and the watermelon flavor. What I got was the tropic thunder flavor with the savage label cover and then weirdly enough I actually got the savage flavor but with a watermelon label :/ luckily I like the pineapple coconut otherwise my review would be a lil more annoyed…. I would like to contact someone so I can get watermelon and I’m not going to order anymore until they guarantee I’m gonna get the right flavors! But if someone contacts me and explains what happened and that they are fixing the problem so I can get the correct flavors then I have no problem giving this drink a 5 star because I actually really like them Read more | 5.0"

I have trouble finding these around me and saw a good sale for them on Amazon.  Buying a case of them comes out to a better price than individually at the store by at least a dollar.  So that is a great value. What I didn’t like is while they are shipped shrink wrapped as shown in the product listing photos, they came in an additional amazon box but when I opened them the cans are all dented.  They are dented in places you wouldn’t expect as well.  There was no leaking and nothing ruptured, just oddly dented cans.

I had to go to the G Fuel site itself in order to figure out what this is.  Apparently, it's supposed to be \"rainbow candy\" flavor. It is a candy flavor, but it's strange.  If I think \"rainbow candy\" I think of things like Skittles, Starburst, or Life Savers or something like that.  It's not close to any of those to me anyway, instead it's this weird artificial candy flavor, as odd as that sounds.  Perhaps an artificial fruit flavor(s) mixed with a hint of coconut?  It's hard to describe and not what I expected. It's not so terrible that I can't drink it---I hate wasting stuff---but I would not buy this again.

Read more | 5.0\nPlease stop packaging them this way!! I adore this flavor and drink. It is my morning “coffee.” I’ve had two whole orders (2 twelve packs in each order) have to be cancelled and returned because they busted in transit. Now, I have an order with a bunch of the cans deformed from smashing around… aka they were 🤏🏻this close to busting also. All of this has just been since they’ve been sent together in a huge box in their new shrink wrapped packaging. The box they’re being shipped in is too big, so they jostle around and smash together. But what I really don’t get is why Mountain Dew changed the packaging??? The cardboard boxes that had each drink in its own cardboard compartment were perfect. Kickstarts have always been known to bust, so the better protection made sense and worked. I get it costs more, so charge a little more or something! I literally buy this flavor in bulk on Amazon because it’s hard to find, and it’s by far my favorite. If I have any of the red flavors for more than a couple days in a row, the red dye gives me migraines. And this flavor has (if I’m not mistaken) the most actual juice content of the flavors. It’s absolutely my go to. Every. Day. It’s not too much caffeine, and it makes me feel GOOD! My entire family swears by “Yellows” as we call them. 😂 We’ve been known to walk in a Dollar General and holler out, “They have Yellows! Get a buggy!” To which the cashier said, “Oh!

I used to drink rockstars and they were simply too big and I could never finish a full can so it would just be wasted.  Because it would be flat later on or the next morning.  You can actually leave these Reb bulls sitting out all day and they don’t go flat.  Third- the price is decent.  They end up being about $1.67 per drink as of this time. That’s not too bad for an energy drink in my opinion.  Last of all, they are a slightly yellow/clear color and do not stain your teeth.  I used to be obsessed with fruit punch rockstars and they were bright red.  I had to quit drinking them because they were staining my teeth.  So I appreciate the fact that these are clear with just a slight yellowish tinge and do not stain my teeth.

    "reviews": "Orange Cream Blueberry Tart Mixed Tray VALR Energy has quickly become my favorite energy drink! The flavor is perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and it gives me hours of smooth, focused energy without the jitters or dreaded crash. Knowing it’s made with natural ingredients makes it an easy, guilt-free choice for staying energized throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the two flavor pack with Orange Cream and Blueberry Tart. Orange Cream was my personal favorite out of the 2. As someone that is picky with energy drinks, I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. Neither had that fake energy drink taste that some of the other brands on the market have. The were tasty but not too sweet. The caffeine content was perfect to give you mental focus but none of the weird jittery feeling. I felt focused and awake all day without any crash also! The nitrogen gives the drinks a little bit of carbonation without being overpowering. As someone that also prioritizes their health, I really like that this brand has clean ingredients and is more geared toward a healthy lifestyle. 10/10 would buy again and recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using VALR Nitrogen Infused energy drinks for a few weeks now, and I’m impressed with the boost they provide without the usual jitters. As an active mother, I need something that helps with both focus and stamina during my workouts, and this does the trick. The smooth, refreshing taste makes it easy to enjoy, and I love that it doesn’t leave me feeling drained later on. Overall, it’s a great energy drink that supports my busy lifestyle Read more | 5.0\nI’m usually pretty hesitant to try most energy drinks because they make me jittery and often taste like chemicals, but I decided to try VALR because of the green tea extract and nitrogenation.. and this is actually delicious! The nitrogen makes the liquid feel thicker/gives the satisfaction of carbonation, without the actual bubbles or gas aftermath.  I got the variety pack to try both flavors- the orange reminded me of an orange and cream sorbet, and the blueberry (my fav) literally just tasted like blueberry green tea. I have the mental and physical energy, without feeling anxious or shaky. Definitely recommend at least giving them a try!! Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who's pretty sensitive to caffeine, this was a nice mid-day pick me up and I could feel my alertness level rise after drinking less than half the can, no jitters. The sweetness level works for me (I like sweet drinks) and the fact that it's infused with nitrogen makes for a really smooth texture that felt like a treat. I'm going to start having one before my workout classes. Orange is my fav - will continue to repurchase! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of an energy drink consumer because most of the drinks on the market have way too much caffeine! The can only has 175mg of caffeine through green tea. I did not experience any weird jitters or crashes after drinking the entire can. The other things I love about the product is its focus on natural juices and flavoring as well as it being nitrogenated. I was also able to drink an entire can before a workout with no bloat that you would typically get from a carbonated drink making my workout comfortable. This is a great product! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been searching for a clean, effective energy drink, and VALR is now my go-to. The taste is refreshing and not overly sweet, which I love. It provides a steady energy boost that keeps me focused for hours without the jittery feeling or crash I’ve experienced with other brands. Plus, it’s packed with natural ingredients, which makes me feel good about drinking it. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nVALR is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the orange, but the blueberry is also super satisfying. I was expecting carbonation like other energy drinks, but the nitrogenated texture was a pleasant surprise. It’s a bit thicker but without the carbonation, so no burping side effects! I’m focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough protein while leading a healthy lifestyle. One thing I love about Valr is that it mixes perfectly with my clear protein powder for a refreshing, energizing boost. It’s delicious on its own and even better with protein. I can’t say enough great things about this energy drink! The energy boost from Valr is different from other drinks. It doesn’t give me a big spike and then a crash. Instead, it provides a natural, lasting boost that maximizes my focus, energy levels, and attentiveness, making it a great companion for my workday mornings. I’m a die-hard fan of the orange flavor and can’t wait to start all my days with it. I’ll be ordering another case soon! I would love to try other flavors as they come out with new ones!

    "reviews": "O.G. Sugar Free O.G. Arrived in great condition and this is the flavor and well carbonated with a bite to the inner mouth I loved. I don’t hate the new version but this is far better. The new is to sweet with grape flavor and less carbonation. Why can’t they just keep making both kinds. Pepsi doesn’t put enough carbonation in any thing the put out or it gets flat fast. In my opinion the best with vodka too. Read more | 5.0\nI've ordered this a couple times before because as we all know the NEW FLAVORS ARE TERRIBLE. In the past I actually received the OG flavor and was happy with the taste but sad it cost so much.  This time I hit the re order button and I got a case of the NEW FLAVOR and I'm peeved. It's super easy to tell the difference between the new and the OG. The new flavors all have 270 calories and the OG only has 250. On that note I have found a 2nd NEW flavor, seemingly grape, which is even WORSE than the 1st NEW flavor, if that's even possible. I'm just hoping to g and s they aren't going to stick with that NASTY GRAPE so they can swindle the 1st NEW flavor as \"OG flavor\".  I'm absolutely livid at this moment and terrified what the future may bring. Read more | 5.0\nHonestly idk why they \"stopped\" making this flavor, aka \"changed\" it but just glad they \"brought it back\" lol idk if it's going to be a permanent thing (but it definitely should) IMHO the original flavor that started it all (in USA at least, Rockstar was THE FIRST energy drink in USA) was the best energy drink on the market. It went away and I'm not even going to lie, I converted to NoS energy drinks and then Monster. Keep this flavor (because it really is different than what the \"now\" \"original\" flavor is) and I'd be loyal to Rockstar again. The OG flavor just truly was where it was at. I ended up buying a pack of this and the original just to make sure over all these years the flavors weren't idk, \"the same\" and they are definitely different. Idk why they \"changed\" it. But just please keep this OG \"throwback\" version as a permanent and I'll be coming back to Rockstar for my normal energy drink. 5/5 all day! Read more | 5.0\nReplacement is same junk.. cannot return item. No refund offered. I'm done. You lost a customer for life. TLDR: NOT OG but they do grow on you if you like a less sweet and more tart drink. After writing rockstar about their terrible new flavor masquerading as the original we all have loved these many years I received a link to this item on amazon. I was well pleased when my first order came in and was the original flavor with that perfect suck on your tongue zing! OG red tab cans with the pre cyberpunk graphics. I was too quick to drink it all down and decided to order more. That's where things fell flat. Literally.. This rockstar is bitter and flat. It doesn't taste anything like the original, nor like the gummy worm stuff they sell in stores. Or sold anyway. I haven't purchased one from a retail store since I bought out the few hundred og cans I could find after they changed the formula. I feel completely let down. How is it that rockstar cannot continue making a drink they made for over a decade? Why even send me to this sales page if they aren't going to keep their promise? I had an open mind when I saw the black tab. I thought maybe they really are back in production. Guess I thought wrong. Why do they keep changing the flavor? Is it a supply shortage? A materials price hike? The movie syrup got it all wrong. It's not about branding at all. It's about flavor. The only energy drink that hasn't failed me now is Red Bull. Guess thats why they cost so much. I tried, Rockstar... I tried. Thanks for the order before this one. It was great.. *edit: While it may not be og, it's definitely not the puke they were pushing in stores. I could probably get used to drinking it if it wasn't 270 calories. Oh well. I needed to quit this stuff anyway. Read more | 1.0\nHands down the best Rockstar / energy drink ever. Ive been drinking these for about a decade and wouldnt dream of drinking anything else. Read more | 5.0\nAll you have to do to wipe the taste out of your mouth (& out of your memory) of the new \"original\" flavor is to drink the \"OG\" flavor for a solid week.  Then drink a new \"original\" again just to see how gross it is. Some say it dosent taste exactly like the old flavor. If you just take a quick swig after drinking the new original all this time, it's not gonna do it.  Rockstar has always been an acquired taste..... and it's gonna take a minute or 2 to retrain your brain to what real Rockstar Energy bliss is....and this is it. Thank you Pepsi/Rockstar/Fritolay/whomever.....for giving us our flavor back.  I am again loyal and grateful Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who worked 16 hours a day and lived on Rockstar, these are not the true OG recipe … the place I worked only had Rockstar in the vending  machine when they first came out and they were ice cold and so good after a hard days work. I got used to the taste. The newer version is flatter, very sweet, misses the taurine or tang or something… it’s like a Coke vs a Pepsi or Sprite vs 7-Up (Pepsi is always sweeter for me).  So when I saw the “OG” were back I was excited. But they do not bring back memories or nostalgia from the original so I do not think they are the same. I gave it a 4 because for the taste and the price versus say Redbull, you can’t beat Rockstar. I miss the version 1’s. Read more | 4.0\nI used to get one of these almost every day trying to survive a work week. I just enjoyed the flavor, in the end, they never really gave me much of an energy boost but they definitely keep me awake at night if I have one too late in the day! Anyway these OG ones have the flavor I always enjoyed, I don't much care for the modern sugar free version. Additionally I am happy to have a little stash of these for my treat now and then because apparently rock stars are very rare in the lower 48 states, I never see them! I currently live away from Alaska and they were almost everywhere there! Missed my Rockstar. Read more | 5.0"

I wish they would formulate 1-2 flavors with out sucralose (monk fruit ideally) for those of us who are health/ingredient conscious. 180 mg is a lot of caffeine for myself, i wish they had the half can option (like alani nu) for when someone just needs a little boost, wants the energy in the afternoon, or for those who are caffeine sensitive.

They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to! The flavor is AMAZING! Energy is AMAZING! And it’s perfect for someone on keto looking for an energy boost! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n1.0\n4.0"

Another big brand energy drink manufacturers came out with a peach flavor that has a super strong fake peach flavor that was so disappointing! I saw this one and decided to try it based on the reviews. They were right. This one has the closest to a real peach flavor, though I wish it was a tad bit sweeter. The problem is I hate these smaller 12oz cans. I'll have to drink 2 of these smaller cans so I'll go through them a lot quicker than the 16oz. Not to mention, the other drink manufacturer has 16oz cans in packs of 15. So, that will last me 2-3 weeks at work. I'll go through this one in a week.

    "bullet_points": "About this item    THE MOST EFFICACIOUS ENERGY DRINK (Over 2000 mg of Nootropics) - Most energy drinks provide nothing more than a jolt of caffeine and a smattering of antioxidants. This approach didn’t address the growing demand for true cognitive support and left much to be desired. Gorilla Mind Energy features an incomparable active ingredient profile designed not only to deliver CNS stimulation but also to push the dopaminergic, serotonergic and cholinergic pathways harder than any energy drink has to date.    COMPLETELY UNIQUE & POTENT ACTIVE INGREDIENT PROFILE - Our ‘Energy Matrix’ produces a distinct amplified focus, unmatched energy, elevated mental clarity, and clearly feels more potent than other energy drinks on the market. Gorilla Mind Energy is the perfect synergy of taste and efficacy.    17 DELICIOUS FLAVORS - Equally as disappointing as the outdated formulations in this industry is the taste of the typical ‘go to’ energy drink. Consumer palates have become far more refined over the past decade, and the bar has been raised for what will stand out in this absurdly saturated market. This is where we take it home. We are VERY confident when we say that all of our flavors will hang with, or beat, any of the big boys in this industry while providing a far more effective formula.    NO SUGAR OR ARTIFICIAL COLORS - Every single one of our energy drink flavors is sugar-free, does not feature any artificial colors, and is as close to calorie-free as possible.    THIRD-PARTY TESTED - This is a premium formula with premium ingredients. Commensurate with that, we employ third-party testing of not just our powder and capsule formulas but also our energy drinks to constantly oversee the purity of our products.    \n   See more product details",

    "reviews": "Wild Grape Tigers Blood Strawberry Candy Sour Watermelon Candy Orange Rush Orange Ice Dream Mango Peach Lychee Bomb Lucky Lemon Exotic Kiwi Bombsicle Blackberry Lemonade Black Cherry Vanilla Berry Burst Arctic White Variety Pack #2 Variety Pack #1 Tropic Wave Going to break this up a bit. Tl:dr, tastes great, works well, price is fine, packaging sucks a bit. Taste: So far I've tried Black Cherry Vanilla and Kiwi. Both are really tasty, but I have a preference for Black Cherry Vanilla. These don't taste like low calorie energy drinks, and not much like energy drinks at all. You don't get that annoying, acidic and metallic taste that many energy drinks have. Instead it's smooth, tastes as advertised, and has no weird aftertaste. If there was a decaf I would drink it for the taste alone. Efficacy: Different people react differently to supplements. With that out of the way, the dosages are well within the \"effective\" range and I haven't found a nootropic on the market with these dosages combined. Derek has a video nearly an hour and a half long on YouTube breaking down the active ingredients, what they do, and studies that back their efficacy. Personally and anecdotally, wowza. The caffeine level is akin to a normal energy drink so you get the initial hit, but no jitters. Then the nootropics kick in (then take 30 min to an hour on average for most people). Focus is insane, word recall is noticable, and mood is enhanced. I got more used to it after a while, but the first day I cleaned most of my house because I was so hyped. At this point, I can't imagine a day without one. I know for the sake of my wallet I should slow down, but I love how both energizing and calming the drink is at the same time. Cost: It's not the cheapest. That said, it is way cheaper than Starbucks or any coffee shop. I often go to my local coffee shop to get work done, but that ends up costing me like $6-7 (with tip) per day for an iced coffee or iced black eye. I would sometimes pop by the corner store to get a Monster for the weekend or something. That was $3, which is cheaper than redbull. If you do the math, as of now Gorilla Mind energy comes out to around $3 a can, and is way higher quality then redbull. So, I'm saving money if I don't go to the coffee shop and breaking even with Monster. Packaging: There are plenty of pictures of cans being damaged and it's true. A few of mine arrived damage, and the quality of the materials on the cans isn't the best. That said, it's so good that I'm not deducting a star. Really a game changer, I recommend giving it a go. If you are unsure, watch Derek's video on YouTube. Read more | 5.0\nI accidentally tried one for free in my work office and immediately have to order a full pack of this from Amazon, I was so impressed by all the active ingredient and efficacy of it. 100% recommend to everyone who want a daily brain boost to replace daily Coffee/Caffeine. Most energy drinks out there are just lots of Sugar and Caffeine, while this one contains all the core Active Ingredient for mind clarity that I regularly take in Pills format, so I don't have to shove in 5-6 pills a day on top of my daily supplements anymore thanks to this. I wish its more widely available in all other Asia countries when I travel. The only downside for me is that the drink is Carbonated which give me mild stomach bloat and gas issue (still less issues than all the other Soda brands), and the Caffeine content is a bit too high for me (200 mg), I usually take 1-2 Caffeine Gums a day (with 50 mg of Caffeine per pill), and 200 mg is a bit too strong for me since I'm very sensitive to Caffeine. Arctic White Flavor taste really good though, just like Sprite with no sugar, now I can fully replaced my daily Coke Zero can with this one. Read more | 5.0\nGreat taste, energy and focus! Love Gorilla Mind products! Read more | 5.0\nI have had two cases previously purchased. The first case was Orange and the flavor was amazing and had no damage. The second case, that was damaged. Not to the point of it needing to be returned but about 25% of the product needed to be opened with tools due to damage sustained in shipping. With the product being amazing I again ordered more but the last two shipments have been damaged to the point Amazon has labeled to be non-deliverable. While it is nice to not have to go through a claim process it is highly frustrating to have two separate orders marked as undeliverable, a refund automated, no new order being immediately processed, and this is already on top of the abnormally longer shipment time for these beverages. I love Gorilla Mind, their products, and their services, it is sadly just apparent there is a disconnect between GM and Amazon as the product can't even arrive to its final destination without being damaged or destroyed. I will give it one more chance before trying to find an alternative option. Read more | 1.0\nNot my favorite flavor but good nonetheless. These drinks keep me focused and alert for work. By far the best energy drink on the market as far as physical and cognitive impact, and taste. Also, this is one of the few energy drinks that uses methycobalimin, along with other excellent vitamins, specifically vitamin C. Read more | 4.0\n5.0"

    "reviews": "Orange Cream Mixed Tray Blueberry Tart VALR Energy has quickly become my favorite energy drink! The flavor is perfectly balanced—not too sweet—and it gives me hours of smooth, focused energy without the jitters or dreaded crash. Knowing it’s made with natural ingredients makes it an easy, guilt-free choice for staying energized throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered the two flavor pack with Orange Cream and Blueberry Tart. Orange Cream was my personal favorite out of the 2. As someone that is picky with energy drinks, I was pleasantly surprised by both flavors. Neither had that fake energy drink taste that some of the other brands on the market have. The were tasty but not too sweet. The caffeine content was perfect to give you mental focus but none of the weird jittery feeling. I felt focused and awake all day without any crash also! The nitrogen gives the drinks a little bit of carbonation without being overpowering. As someone that also prioritizes their health, I really like that this brand has clean ingredients and is more geared toward a healthy lifestyle. 10/10 would buy again and recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using VALR Nitrogen Infused energy drinks for a few weeks now, and I’m impressed with the boost they provide without the usual jitters. As an active mother, I need something that helps with both focus and stamina during my workouts, and this does the trick. The smooth, refreshing taste makes it easy to enjoy, and I love that it doesn’t leave me feeling drained later on. Overall, it’s a great energy drink that supports my busy lifestyle Read more | 5.0\nI’m usually pretty hesitant to try most energy drinks because they make me jittery and often taste like chemicals, but I decided to try VALR because of the green tea extract and nitrogenation.. and this is actually delicious! The nitrogen makes the liquid feel thicker/gives the satisfaction of carbonation, without the actual bubbles or gas aftermath.  I got the variety pack to try both flavors- the orange reminded me of an orange and cream sorbet, and the blueberry (my fav) literally just tasted like blueberry green tea. I have the mental and physical energy, without feeling anxious or shaky. Definitely recommend at least giving them a try!! Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who's pretty sensitive to caffeine, this was a nice mid-day pick me up and I could feel my alertness level rise after drinking less than half the can, no jitters. The sweetness level works for me (I like sweet drinks) and the fact that it's infused with nitrogen makes for a really smooth texture that felt like a treat. I'm going to start having one before my workout classes. Orange is my fav - will continue to repurchase! Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of an energy drink consumer because most of the drinks on the market have way too much caffeine! The can only has 175mg of caffeine through green tea. I did not experience any weird jitters or crashes after drinking the entire can. The other things I love about the product is its focus on natural juices and flavoring as well as it being nitrogenated. I was also able to drink an entire can before a workout with no bloat that you would typically get from a carbonated drink making my workout comfortable. This is a great product! Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been searching for a clean, effective energy drink, and VALR is now my go-to. The taste is refreshing and not overly sweet, which I love. It provides a steady energy boost that keeps me focused for hours without the jittery feeling or crash I’ve experienced with other brands. Plus, it’s packed with natural ingredients, which makes me feel good about drinking it. Highly recommend it for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to traditional energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nVALR is absolutely delicious! My favorite is the orange, but the blueberry is also super satisfying. I was expecting carbonation like other energy drinks, but the nitrogenated texture was a pleasant surprise. It’s a bit thicker but without the carbonation, so no burping side effects! I’m focusing on staying hydrated and getting enough protein while leading a healthy lifestyle. One thing I love about Valr is that it mixes perfectly with my clear protein powder for a refreshing, energizing boost. It’s delicious on its own and even better with protein. I can’t say enough great things about this energy drink! The energy boost from Valr is different from other drinks. It doesn’t give me a big spike and then a crash. Instead, it provides a natural, lasting boost that maximizes my focus, energy levels, and attentiveness, making it a great companion for my workday mornings. I’m a die-hard fan of the orange flavor and can’t wait to start all my days with it. I’ll be ordering another case soon! I would love to try other flavors as they come out with new ones!

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Bundle C4 Smart Energy Official Variety Pack Tropical Passion-fruit Tropical Oasis Variety Pack Strawberry Guava Peach Mango Nectar Cherry Berry Lime Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Yuzu Black Cherry Berry Breeze Variety Pack C4 Brain & Body Official Variety Pack Watermelon Burst The media could not be loaded. As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost. I still prefer Rockstar or Monster overall. Read more | 4.0\nCellucor is the best energy drink on the market.  The flavors are great, and just the right amount of energy.

This flavor is very unique and I haven’t really tasted anything else like this except a limeade from sonic a very long time ago. This monster has another unique thing and that’s the nitrogen they used instead of carbonation. You can tell there’s a difference there. The flavor had some getting use to at first, almost like a wine. But by the 3rd or 4th one I was hooked! One of my top 5 monster flavors now for sure. Would buy again.

    "reviews": "Love the taste. Read more | 5.0\nI have used the standard 5-hour Energy drinks before, but had never tried the 'Extra Strength' version.  So when I got the opportunity to try them out I jumped at it.  I mainly use these drinks for a pre-workout boost, which is how I tested this one. The manufacturer recommends either consuming 1/2 a bottle for 'moderate energy' or a full bottle for 'maximum energy'.  They also suggest no more than 2 bottles daily; consumed several hours apart.  Since I was testing the benefits of use as a pre-workout energy booster, I went for the full bottle. The first thing I noted was the flavor.  The name 'Tidal Twist' implies something tropical, and the first flavor I picked up was a hint of coconut, with sort of a fruit background.  As with most energy drinks, the flavor is not great, but it definitely is not unpleasant. Of course the reason I was taking the energy shot was to boost my workout.  Per the manufacturer each bottle (shot) contains the caffeine equivalent to a 12-oz cup of premium coffee (230 mg), in addition to an 'energy blend'.  I took the shot roughly 30 minutes prior to starting my workout, which was a 50-minute stationary cycling workout followed by some light weight lifting.  I definitely had an added boost to my endurance, which was measured in my average RPMs and calories burned on the ride.  I also still had good energy for the weights, and there was no post-workout crash. A concern I have with any energy boosting supplement is potential stomach upset.  I am happy to say I did not experience any negative side effects.  One effect of note, which is mentioned by the manufacturer is potential for 'niacin flushing'.  I can definitely say I did run hotter, and sweat more, during the workout after taking this energy shot.  But, I did not view this as a negative so did not deduct from the product rating for it. Read more | 5.0\nI have been a fan of 5 hour products on every long trip I have had with a set arrival time. These are double shot bottles, meaning every bottle is two servings. I recommend only using half of one at a time. I am accustomed to the normal 5 hour flavor, being mostly overpowered by b12. These however, are strongly  masked by a pineapple/coconut flavor, but followed up by a terrible after taste that lasts about three seconds. So, it lost a star for my, and what I would assume to be general tastes of others. . Buy these is you like tropical flavors, but don't like the other 5 hour existing flavors. Read more | 4.0\nI have tried other brands of energy drinks as well as different flavors of this same vitamin energy drink and found that this is the best kind of energy drink for my focus and relief from tiredness. I use half a bottle in the morning  and the other half midday. I haven't noticed any unsteadiness or jitters, which is wonderful compared to other caffeine drinks that have left me feeling shaky. This vitamin drink has lots of vitamin b though also a lot of caffeine, but doesn't give me a let down or crash feeling at all. It's easy to take and since they are so well sealed and the screw lids stay on well, I  can carry it around, even after I drink half of it, the second half doesn't spill out. However, this particular flavor is not my favorite. It's kind of a sour sweet tangy taste, but there's a  metallic taste that I don't get from other flavors. Read more | 5.0\nThese 5-hour energy drinks work really well and very fast. When I tried the first one I couldn't believe how quickly I began to feel energized. And I was really struggling that morning to keep focused on work. These things were a life saver. So easy to drink. You can down the entire thing in just one or two gulps. And the flavor was really nice. I've had some other energy drinks that were nasty tasting going down and lingered with more nasty aftertaste. These were not that way at all. They go down smooth with no lingering aftertaste. That is very much appreciated. And the energy I got from the first bottle lasted several hours. I was able to finish my work day with no problem. This product has made a believer out of me. I will definitely be buying it again. I highly recommend it if you ever need that quick pick me up. Read more | 5.0\nEnergy level seemed on par with other 5-hour energy extra strength flavors, same amount of side effects as well (nothing new there). As someone who doesn't particularly enjoy the taste of most flavors of these, I can say these aren't any better or worse for me. They do have a hint of \"tropical\" pineapple/coconut and a terrible after taste (which again seems standard) but for the most part I'm in it for the energy and not the flavor. I could see me buying these again. The price is a bit much, but if you are buying these individually at a convenience store every day Amazon could be saving you some cash. Read more | 5.0\nThe 5-Hour Energy Extra Strength Shots in Tidal Twist Flavor deliver the consistent energy boost you'd expect from this brand, but the flavor is intense and unique. Pros: ✔ Highly Effective – Provides a strong and lasting energy boost without the jitters or crash. ✔ Convenient Size – Small and easy to take on the go, perfect for a quick pick-me-up. ✔ Extra Strength Formula – Great for when you need maximum alertness and focus. Cons: ✘ Bold Flavor – Has a distinct tropical citrus taste. Maybe perfumey...which may not be for everyone. ✘ Intensity Overload – If you're sensitive to strong flavors, this one might be too overpowering. While the flavor may be hit or miss, the effectiveness is undeniable. If you need an energy boost that works, this extra strength shot gets the job done! Read more | 5.0\nI thought this was a little hard to drink because I thought it wasted kind of bad. The flavor does taste tropical. Something like coconut, but it was a little bitter and also incredibly sweet. Luckily each bottle is relatively small. It did give me energy, though it also made me a bit unfocused and jittery. I don't recommend downing the whole bottle, but taking little sips especially for those who aren't used to energy drinks. Read more | 3.0"

If you love gfuel buy this gfuel. I love it. All jokes aside the flavor is pretty good, It's a sweet but just right type of flavor.

I would recommended this flavor for anybody that wants to stock up on gfuel cans or just to try! Read more | 5.0\nI love G-Fuel since it’s no sugar.  I have trouble finding these around me and saw a good sale for them on Amazon.  Buying a case of them comes out to a better price than individually at the store by at least a dollar.  So that is a great value. What I didn’t like is while they are shipped shrink wrapped as shown in the product listing photos, they came in an additional amazon box but when I opened them the cans are all dented.  They are dented in places you wouldn’t expect as well.  There was no leaking and nothing ruptured, just oddly dented cans.

I had to go to the G Fuel site itself in order to figure out what this is.  Apparently, it's supposed to be \"rainbow candy\" flavor. It is a candy flavor, but it's strange.  If I think \"rainbow candy\" I think of things like Skittles, Starburst, or Life Savers or something like that.  It's not close to any of those to me anyway, instead it's this weird artificial candy flavor, as odd as that sounds.  Perhaps an artificial fruit flavor(s) mixed with a hint of coconut?  It's hard to describe and not what I expected. It's not so terrible that I can't drink it---I hate wasting stuff---but I would not buy this again.

    "reviews": "Wild Fruit Punch Orange Mango Tropical Life I enjoy zero or low calorie energy drinks . I saw these on sale and decided to give them a try . I bought a few flavors , this is about the Fruit Punch in particular as it's a very common flavor amongst energy drinks . The first sip gave me an immediate hint of grain cereal smell , a smell that I personally love . It is not carbonated so it's smooth going down . The fruity flavor is strong and pleasant . It's got a lot of flavor going on for only 35 calories . The only slight aftertaste that I get is again of grain cereal and it's very light . I like these a lot , recommended . Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor isn’t fruit punch, bland and kind of metal flavor. Not impressed. I will not be purchasing it again. Sorry Read more | 1.0\nThis is an energy drink that has lots of energy and lots of flavor. It tastes and drinks like fruit juice. The fruit punch flavor was absolutely delicious. Reminded me of the fruit punch I used to drink as a kid, but without sugar. I drank it in the morning and stayed focused and energized pretty much the entire day. Looking forward to trying the other flavors. Read more | 5.0\nI had really high hopes for this one, excited that it is non-carbonated and figured it would be great for mornings.  The flavor isn't terrible and it's smooth but it has such a powerful herbal/vitamin smell and taste that completely overpowers any orange or mango flavor.  Kinda struggling to drink them. I mean it does the trick with more caffeine than most energy drinks, but man that herbal taste and smell just kinda wrecks it for me. Read more | 2.0\nSmells like pee that's been sitting around a while. Taste isn't awful but the smell makes it undrinkable really. Read more | 1.0\nSo this product isn’t bad per se. I gave it 3 stars (it’s more like 3.5), but it could easily be 4 star. I prefer uncarbonated energy drinks but most are lower on the caffeine content, so I was glad to see one with 260 mg for those days when I need a little more oomph. Where this product goes wrong is in the taste which could be a death sentence for an energy drink. While I don’t mind the taste, it’s a little cough syrupy and will easily turn off some consumers. The big problem with the taste is really the result of there being whey protein in this product. It changes the texture and gives it an off taste. Hard to describe but if you’ve ever had a liquid protein drink (think fruit drink not protein shake), you know the taste I’m talking about. If it was giving me 10-20 grams of protein, I might be ok to overlook the weird taste as it’s expected, but this product contains only 3 grams??? What’s the point?? It’s totally unnecessary and I think removing it would do wonders for the overall taste. What benefit am I really getting from 3 grams of protein? All that being said, I still kinda like it and have bought it a few times. And if it ever comes back in stock, I’d probably buy it again. I prefer the fruit punch over the tropical (I haven’t tried the other flavor) even if it tastes like protein cough syrup. I just hope the manufacturer reads these reviews because I see I’m not the only person to call out the protein taste. Take it out and I think you’d have a much superior product to market. But that’s just my opinion. Read more | 3.0\nI bought this for what it does - good energy, plus some protein, and zero sugar - and it does that, so I am happy. Taste is perfectly reasonable. I'm not looking for a decadent cocktail. I want energy, plus protein, with zero sugar. Read more | 5.0\nTastes mostly like powdery protein. Did not like the flavor of this at all - couldn't taste the orange/mango over the overpowering taste of powdery protein. If they left the Protein out it might taste better, and 3g of Protein doesn't seem worth it for the bad taste. Would not buy again. Read more | 1.0"

    "reviews": "Tropical Taste Pack Fruity Flavors Bundle Wild Orange White Peach Tropical Punch Super Berry Strawberry Watermelon Remix Variety Pack Pineapple Coconut Mango Splash Green Apple Frosted Grape Cherry Limeade Dwanta's Holiday Punch Variety Pack Alright, let’s talk energy drinks. I’ve tried a bunch of them, and Zoa energy drinks are definitely up there with the best. They’re packed with good stuff like vitamins, electrolytes, and amino acids, and they give me a solid energy boost without making me feel jittery. Plus, the flavors are pretty awesome – I mean, who doesn’t love a good Tropical Punch or Pineapple Coconut? But here’s the thing – as much as I love Zoa for a midday pick-me-up, I still start my mornings with Yerba Magic. There’s just something about it that sets the tone for the day. Yerba Magic is this fantastic instant yerba mate drink that’s super easy to make. Just mix a scoop with water, and you’re good to go. No steeping, no fuss – perfect for my groggy, half-asleep self in the morning. Yerba Magic has this refreshing peach mango flavor that’s a nice wake-up call. It’s packed with prebiotics and probiotics, so my gut feels great, and the energy boost is smooth and steady. I don’t get those annoying jitters or crashes, which is a huge win. It’s like all the benefits of traditional yerba mate without the hassle of brewing it. I usually get mine in less than two days when I order it off Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5YVMX9Q Yerba Magic is loaded with prebiotics and probiotics, which are key players in maintaining a healthy digestive system. The prebiotics, like chicory inulin and apple fiber, help nourish the good bacteria in your gut, making them more effective. This, in turn, supports better digestion and overall gut health. Since I started drinking Yerba Magic, I’ve noticed a significant reduction in bloating and digestive discomfort. So, my routine goes like this: I kick off the day with Yerba Magic to get my head straight and my energy flowing. Then, if I need an extra boost later in the day, I grab a Zoa. It’s the perfect combo – Yerba Magic keeps me focused and balanced in the morning, and Zoa gives me that extra push when I need it, especially during those afternoon slumps. In short, Zoa energy drinks are fantastic, but Yerba Magic is my go-to for starting the day right. If you’re looking for a great way to boost your mornings and stay energized throughout the day, give this combo a try. You won’t be disappointed! Read more | 5.0\nNew favorite energy drink! All of the flavors were good, although, not a huge fan of the watermelon. Has about 160mg of caffeine vs other drinks with 200. Caffeine comes from green tea and green coffee beans. Has multiple vitamins and electrolytes. I wish I could find them in bulk at stores! Read more | 5.0\nI was a hardcore Celcius fan and prior to that a Red Bull fan. But wanted to give ZOA a try. I first tried the Tropical Punch flavor and right away, love it! It doesn't have the weird \"fake sugar\" taste that usually gives me a headache. It's crisp and honestly tastes like a light, fresh, less sweet Hawaiian Punch with a little fizz. And NO JITTERS! It's a clean, smooth energy that doesn't feel unnatural. I love that it comes in a 16-ounce option. My only complaint is the price because it can be pricey at times but it does seem to fluctuate. Cherry flavor is good as well. Read more | 5.0\nZoa Energy is my go-to energy beverage.  I love the orange flavor. Do not like the big price increase that’s recently occurred which is why I’m deducting 1-star. Read more | 4.0\nWill buy again! I was looking for a drink that isn't too sweet, doesn't taste like chemicals or smell like a beer. This is it! The fruit flavor is a little too mild for my liking. But, it's great just the same! I live the variety, the not overbearing sweetness. I like to share new products with my co workers which is what I did when these arrived. I do believe we will all be ordering these in the future. Green 🍏 apple is good. Pineapple Coconut 🍍🥥is good. Not a huge fan of anything peach flavored. But the white peach 🍑is good too. Next on the list is Orange 🍊 , and I am looking forward to that! Read more | 5.0\nNot much on sports drinks but I do like the Zoe flavor original taste with low calories and green tea pick me up. However, I have been trying to buy more orders through Amazone and have had little to no success.  I hope the I can see this product in local Wal-Mart, Cosco, or GMC in the northeast parts of Texas. This product I definitely would like to continue to purchase. Read more | 5.0\nGreat flavor, it doesn’t take like it’s sugar free! I’m very happy I could find the 16oz cans again!

The flavor is like a fruity, sparkling party in a can—perfectly sweet with no sugar and no weird aftertaste. It’s hard to describe the flavor exactly, but it feels like a mix of berry and grape with a fun, cosmic twist. What’s even better is that it gives me the energy I need without the crash. I drink it in the afternoon for a pick-me-up, and it keeps me going through work or a workout. The fact that it’s sugar-free makes it guilt-free too! The packaging is super cute and eye-catching, and the carbonation level is just right—not too fizzy, not flat. I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious and refreshing energy drink. This one is my absolute favorite flavor from Alani Nu, and I can’t wait to keep stocking up! Read more | 5.0\nI recently started using Alani Nutrition products, and I am so impressed! The Alani Energy Drinks are my new go-to for a quick pick-me-up. They taste amazing (I’m obsessed with the Watermelon flavor!), and they give me a clean, sustained energy boost without any jitters or crashes. I’ve also tried the Alani Pre-Workout, and it delivers on all fronts—great taste, increased energy, and enhanced focus during my workouts. I love how it’s packed with ingredients that actually make a difference in my performance, plus it doesn’t upset my stomach like some other pre-workouts do. What I really appreciate is how Alani uses high-quality, transparent ingredients with no artificial junk. Plus, their products are all about supporting a healthy lifestyle, which resonates with me. If you're looking for a delicious, effective, and clean energy boost or supplement, I highly recommend giving Alani Nutrition a try. I can’t wait to try more products from them!

    "reviews": "Watermelon Salt Variety Pack Grapefruit Salt Citrus Salt Black Cherry Lime I love these drinks. Seeing patients all day on the hour it’s hard to stay hydrated. I have one a day and can tell a big difference ! It helps me stay hydrated and also curves my cravings for sugar. I love the taste it’s almost like I crave it.  I don’t care how much they cost. You can’t  put a price on your health especially in a world full of processed foods . I have also noticed it’s helped with my digestive tract and staying regular. Read more | 5.0\nI'm a chronically dehydrated ADHD person on medication that causes even more dehydration. These drinks and the packets are a lifesaver. The taste is, well extremely salty, but not bad. They taste better from the cans than the packets in my experience but the packets are easier to keep around and to adjust to whatever size water bottle I'm using that day. They're the only thing I've found that actually helps with a hangover, they help with energy levels, the magnesium helps me sleep better, they're just top quality all around. I've tried every hydration/electrolyte drink on the market and these are by far the best I've found for my needs. I feel hydrated without being in the bathroom all day, with no extra sugar like the usual sports drinks. They're worth the cost, I put them on subscribe and save and I haven't been dehydrated since.

They do taste like alcohol tho in my opinion -The citrus salt taste just like a mojito to me. -The watermelon salt taste like a fruit punch four loco -The black cherry lime like a flat roman coke but nice cheery taste -I despise grapefruit but the grapefruit salt one is actually my favorite. Usually it takes me all day and night to drink a can because it's salty but I was able to drink it in less then an hour..leave my breath smell like alcohol back taste in a way.

    "reviews": "Root Beer Pink Lemonade Peach Mango Orange Sunrise Dr. Bum Citrus Burst Cherry Frost Champion Mentality Blueberry Lemonade Blue Snow Cone Grape I love BUM Energy drinks, I can't get enough of them, I guess you could say I'm addicted, a true BUMaholic(TM). Sorry Chris, can't use that one. BUM Energy drinks are unique. They taste like a soda, feel like a soda, and look like one. I'm tired of the overly sweet, 300mg caffeine energy drinks trying to get the biggest can out there for consumer gluttony. So when I found BUM, I gave it a try and became hooked. BUM energy drinks give you a slight caffeine boost and uptick in mental clarity. I enjoy a cup or two of coffee in the morning, but in the afternoon I'll drink one of these to keep me going before a workout. I have had almost every flavor of BUM, there is still the elusive pink lemonade I haven't been able to find yet. But for flavor ratings: Cherry Frost : tastes like a Cherry Cola. The best in my opinion. Root Beer: does have a slight \"diet\" flavor, but the best of the root beer energy drinks I've had. If you enjoy root beer you'll enjoy this. Cirtus Blast: If you're familiar with Sprite or 7up, this is very similar: crisp, clean citrus flavor. Champion Mentality: tough choice between this and orange sunrise. Champion Mentality takes this spot for me because it is lighter on the sweetness. Slightly more tart flavor than Citrus Blast. Orange Sunrise: A bit, sweet, but not too much. Almost like an orange popsicle, but very refreshing. Blue Snow Cone: its been a while since I have had this one, a little harder to find at times. It's a sweet flavor, very reminiscent of the \"blue\" flavor of similar drinks. IYKYK Blueberry Lemonade: this is tangy, very slight blueberry flavor with a tangy, acidic after taste. I find this to be a refreshing, sipping beverage. It gets me excited for the pink lemonade! Peach Mango: I'm a huge fan of these two flavors and the combination had me excited. I found it to be a little on the sweet side with a bit more \"diet\" taste. Still a very refreshing drink and one to try if you're a fan of the flavor combination. If you haven't tried BUM Energy drinks yet, you're missing out on the best energy drinks out there. For those of you who like energy drinks, give these a try. One sip and you'll be hooked, switching from the Reigns, Bangs, Monsters, etc. You just cannot beat the quality of these drinks, you get no jitters or crash, just clean energy. Chris, how about a simple \"Cola\" flavor? And don't change the cans, I love the simplicity of a 12oz soda can. Read more | 5.0\nI'm writing because the review checker gives the quality of reviews on this listing an F... but I purchased this product bc I'm trying to lower the amount of caffeine I drink (I was drinking A LOT for me to be coming down to BUM's level). Suffice to say, I've now gone through one pack and I am now a customer. the product is EXCELLENT. Just enough caffeine, it's not a giantic can of drinnk so you don't feel bloated like with a monster or ghost or rockstar and above all... The ROOTBEER is EXCELLENT. Like wow, the taste is great. Cannot emphasize to you that after drinking dozens of brands over the decades that this one is a stand out. I am waiting on their Dr. Bum flavor... and I wish they would come out with a Cola flavor but so far, I want to commend them on a great product in the midrange Caffeination (is that word? IS NOW !) for folks who are discovering that their kidneys might matter in the future. KEep up the good work Bum! Read more | 5.0\nGreat product, the flavor is on point and ingredients are awesome!

I'd say its got the same taste as the regular green cans but these have a \"smoother\" taste. Import is also about 2oz more than the standard 16oz, hence more caffeine. Oh and it has a fancy sort of resealable design in the form of a cap that you slide open/close. The only downside I see here is the price.

It's tasty, gives me steady energy, and keeps me feeling good even after my workout. If you're looking for something to help you power through your gym sessions without the crash, I definitely recommend giving this a try! Extended explanation: I've been trying out the drink for a month now, and I have to say, it's been a game-changer for my workouts! I'm not an expert, but I do try different pre workout drinks and I know what makes me feel good, and this drink definitely does the trick. **Taste and Flavor** First off, the Guava Paradise flavor is delicious! When this went on sale, I only bought two cans because I typically dislike the flavor of guava drinks. This one, however, is not like that it is so perfect. It's got this perfect mix of sweet and tart that makes it super refreshing. Plus, it's not too fizzy, so it doesn't leave me feeling bloated. **Energy Boost** What I love most about this drink is the energy boost it gives me. I feel more awake and ready to tackle my workout without feeling jittery. The energy comes on smoothly and lasts throughout my session, which is awesome because I hate that crash you get with some other energy drinks. **No Crash** Speaking of crashes, there's none with this one! I can go through my entire workout and still feel good afterward. It's great for those days when I need a little extra push but don't want to feel wiped out later. Read more | 5.0\nThese are delicious. There’s a strong green apple flavor, but it’s not overly sour or difficult to drink. There’s a decent amount of caffeine in each can (180 mg in 12 fluid ounces) so they provide a good kick. Keep this flavor around! Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor was great at first but the aftertaste is something else. I'm not a fan but you might be. Either way I can't return it.. bummer. Read more | 4.0\nThese are disgusting. I was hoping they’d taste “citrusy” like the Ecto Cooler from the 80s. Boy was I wrong. Not even a hint of good flavor. It smells and tastes like Flintstones Vitamins. Picked up 3 different Ghostbusters themed flavors for the Buy 2 Get 1 Free deal. Now I have 11 more of these in the case to try and drink. Not sure if that’s gonna work out. Pass on these. Read more | 1.0\nThey stink when you open them! Smells so bad. But I like the taste. It's like a lime flavor to me. Read more | 3.0\nI recently started using Oxyshred Proton Plasma, and it has truly transformed my mornings. This supplement provides a smooth, long-lasting energy boost without the jitters, keeping me focused and productive throughout the day. Its formula supports weight management by enhancing metabolism, which has made my workouts more effective. I've noticed improvements in both endurance and recovery as a result. The delicious flavor options are an added bonus, making it easy to mix with water or smoothies. Overall, Oxyshred Proton Plasma is a game-changer that elevates my daily performance and supports my fitness goals. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love this drink. I order this so much. Grape, Cali Cola and Tangerine Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been trying out different energy drinks, this one is not one of my favorites.  It’s not terrible but this is not one of the better ones on the market in my opinion. - It’s advertised as not jittery energy, but it feels very jittery to me. I feel shaky, less focused, not more. Almost anxious. I don’t know why. - it’s very acidic, and can be tough on your stomach.  Lifting weights with a stomachache is actually detrimental in the gym, makes your workout worse, not better. - I got the Guava flavor, I don’t expect energy drinks to be delicious and maybe the other flavors are better, but this one tastes like Guava flavored gasoline.  Bangs flavors don’t have that yuck effect, it’s hard to want to finish a whole can of this product even though it’s only 12 oz. For ‘moderate’ caffeine, I’d rather drink a rehab iced tea by monster, not carbonated, no stomachache, tastes good, and provides some hydration with a good energy level that doesn’t leave you feeling strung out like a speed addict when it wears off. For maximum energy hit when you really need to get crazy in the gym and don’t give a crap about anything else, nothing I’ve tried so far beats a full bottle of Redline.  Can’t be healthy for you but it’s the most powerful I’ve tried and it’s 3 gulps, no carbonation, and you’re ready to throw a fit with the weights.  Just don’t take it late in the day, you’ll regret it. I gave Oxyshred a try, won’t be ordering it again. Read more | 2.0\n2.0"

    "reviews": "Reserve White Pineapple Reserve Orange Dreamsicle pineapple orange These are the best flavor of any Monster Energy drink. I mean, orange cream, what could be better! Let’s go ahead and breakdown the flavor combination on this one. It’s got one hell of a profile! I’ll start with the orange. The orange flavor on these is so good. I thought I was somewhere warm with an actual orange! It’s like a vacation in a can! Then there’s the 2nd part of the flavor, the cream. The cream flavor was super creamy. It literally reminds me of that meme of the Amish woman churning cream with that wooden Amish thing. I’ve been drinking Monster products and other energy drinks for about 25 years. With my vast experience and the countless cans I’ve tried there has only been one other drink that was better than this one… the Lost perfect 10, and since that is no longer produced, this is the best energy drink on the market today. Read more | 5.0\nThis Monster Energy Orange Dreamsicle is like sipping pure nostalgia while getting hit by a lightning bolt of energy. Imagine your favorite childhood ice cream truck pulling up, but instead of a dreamsicle, you get a can full of rocket fuel for adults. One sip and I was ready to tackle my to-do list, reorganize my life, and possibly start a small business – all while reminiscing about summer days as a kid. It’s got the perfect orange-vanilla flavor that hits just right, but don’t let the smooth taste fool you – this stuff will have you buzzing around like a caffeinated hummingbird. I’m not saying it gives you superpowers, but I did finish a week’s worth of work in about two hours after downing one. Side note: my hands were shaking, but that’s a small price to pay for this kind of productivity. If you want to relive your childhood and feel like you can run through walls, this is the drink for you. 10/10, would definitely recommend – but proceed with caution unless you’re ready to be a human tornado.

Just know your cans are going to look like they have been thrown down a flight of stairs. Read more | 4.0\nThe price is better than most places.

I love anything that is blueberry, blackberry, or sort of tangy tasting and these are so good and tangy. Second- they are the perfect size. I used to drink rockstars and they were simply too big and I could never finish a full can so it would just be wasted. Because it would be flat later on or the next morning. You can actually leave these Reb bulls sitting out all day and they don’t go flat. Third- the price is decent. They end up being about $1.67 per drink as of this time. That’s not too bad for an energy drink in my opinion. Last of all, they are a slightly yellow/clear color and do not stain your teeth.

Read more | 5.0\nRed Bull has been my go-to energy drink for years, and this 24-pack is a convenient and cost-effective way to keep a steady supply on hand. Taste: The classic Red Bull flavor is unique – a blend of sweetness and tartness with a slight medicinal note. It's definitely an acquired taste, but I personally enjoy it. The carbonation adds a refreshing kick, and the 8.4 fl oz size is perfect for a quick boost without feeling overwhelmed. Effectiveness: Red Bull is known for its ability to provide a quick burst of energy, and it delivers on that promise. The combination of caffeine, taurine, and B vitamins helps me power through long workdays, workouts, or late-night study sessions. I notice a significant improvement in my focus and alertness within minutes of drinking it. Ingredients: While Red Bull is effective, it's important to be mindful of the ingredients. It does contain a significant amount of sugar and caffeine, so moderation is key. I wouldn't recommend drinking it every day, but it's a great option for occasional use when you need an extra boost. Packaging: The 24-pack is great for stocking up. The cans are sturdy and easy to transport, and the packaging keeps them fresh. Overall: If you're looking for a reliable energy drink that delivers a noticeable energy boost, Red Bull is a solid choice. The 24-pack is a convenient and cost-effective option, and while the taste might not be for everyone, the effectiveness is undeniable.

    "reviews": "ZERO Variety Pack Variety Pack Punch Variety Pack ZERO Wild Strawberry Watermelon ZERO Wild Ice Pop ZERO Wild Berry Yerba Mate Tropical Punch Peach Mango Original Lite Fruit Punch ZERO Wild Ruby Red Love these flavors! Caffeine content just right for me. I only drink half a can a day and it supplies enough energy to get me going on days I don’t have time to make coffee Read more | 5.0\nTastes good, quality ingredients and kept me awake to finish term papers overnight. Read more | 5.0\nIf you're anything like me, you have a busy life, and getting 8+ hours of sleep every night just doesn't happen. You need something to get through your day, and the proliferation of mass-market energy drinks has led you to chugging one, two, three or even more in a day! Not good! I know my own Bed Rull (clever!) drinking was getting out-of-control, and it was having a serious impact on both my health and my wallet. In my desperation for a source of healthier, more cost and eco friendly energy, I turned to my local natural grocery store and found this: GURU Lite. Made with Stevia instead of all those \"let's all wait for the news story about the horrible health impacts\" artificial sweeteners, and containing only ingredients you can actually pronounce (sparking water, lemon juice, cane juice, guarana seed, luo han gua juice, steevia, echinacea, ginko, ginseng)it sounded pretty promising. But what about the energy? Well it works, I took my first sip, went \"oh well, crap, doesn't work\" and then 2 minutes later I was awake! No jitters, no \"surge-o-epic caffeine\" - just awake. It's refreshing, if you're used to the \"wired wired wired wired zing zoom bzzzzz crash!\" of normal energy drinks, get ready for one that actually just makes you feel like yourself. Not wired, not tired, not cranky, not crazy, just a couple extra hours of focus as YOU! But what about the flavor? GURU Lite is best described as \"not bad\", I like it room temperature, you may prefer it chilled. Unlike those commercial heart-attacks-in-a-can, GURU focused on health over sugar-load, so expect a slightly lemony, earthy herbal taste. It is not by an means bad tasting, but it's not like liquid candy, it's a simple, natural flavor that doesn't overwhelm or make you want to chug twenty of them. You drink this for the health and energy, and the taste is secondary. I don't want you to think \"oh it tastes bad...\" because it doesn't, it's just the taste is definitely not the focus, it's not a soda, it's more like a glass of water - you drink it because you're thirsty, and this, you drink because you are tired and want to be awake. What about the cost? Well, Amazon has the best deal around. I chose the subscribe-and-save option and came home to find a box, wrapped in a clear plastic wrap to protect against rain, two days later. Inside was my case of GURU (which looks exactly like the picture). I found with GURU not only am I drinking fewer of them than I did with Bed Rull, but I'm able to sleep better and of course I'm ending each month with tons of cash in my pocket that is no longer being spent on over-priced, junk-laden commercial \"energy\". And the best part? I have all the energy I want at hand in a far, far healthier package. Give it a shot today, you will be pleasantly surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI don’t typically like sparkling drinks. They are hard to drink. They tend to make me feel bloated, and usually they taste terrible because they’re meant to be on the lighter side, calorie wise. For example, Celsius sparkling drinks. I LOVE the non carbonates drinks they make! But the sparkling/carbonation side of them make them hard to enjoy, and the taste is not as good as their non carbonated drinks. If you’ve tried them, you know what I mean. These drinks are also sparkling, but somehow they aren’t as “carbonated” feeling and tasting! Impressive! They have a perfect balance for that effect. Makes it easier to chug when I’m in a hurry. Was also worried about the taste! I’ve never tasted Yerba mate, so I was expecting a very strong earthy taste. It mostly taste like a delicate mint taste with a mild “artificial” sweetening aftertaste and a hint of tea. Seriously impressed. Usually when you see all these healthier ingredients you know it’s good for you, or better for you anyways, but you know it’s probably not going to taste very good. One example of a “lighter” drink such as this one, or similar anyways as far as the use of “better ingredients” in the product, is the jocko willink energy drink. In the ingredients list, you will see things that will make you feel better about drinking the product. But it doesn’t taste good at all. This drink has great ingredients and balanced use of them to give it just enough taste and carbonation, to enjoy. I’m amazed with this product and will buy two more of these cases. I regret not getting the variety packs at sams when they did carry them, because I want to try the other flavors. Give these a shot if you so t mins a light tasting, light carbonation effect energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI wasted $50.00 on an unsuspecting change in recipe that showed up at my door.  The GURU original use to be AMAZING, now it takes like overly sweet artificial crap.  There was no warning on this change, so BEWARE.  If you like the beverage in the can without the \"Good Energy Original\" writing at the bottom of the can, this is no longer in existence.

    "reviews": "I snagged a 12-pack of CELSIUS Sparkling Kiwi Guava, and dude, it’s my new pre-workout jam! The kiwi-guava combo is tart, sweet, and tropical—sips like a vacation vibe. No sugar, no junk like aspartame or high fructose corn syrup, just clean energy from green tea and guarana. I felt the kick without the jitters, thanks to that MetaPlus blend with B vitamins and chromium—kept me pumped and not starving mid-run. It’s vegan, gluten-free, and Kosher, so it fits my picky diet. The 12 oz. slim cans are clutch for on-the-go. Only beef? It’s fizzy, so if you’re not into carbonation, heads-up. Otherwise, it’s a solid pick-me-up for crushing goals and staying fit without the usual energy drink crash. CELSIUS, you’ve got a fan!

It’s my favorite from the Celsius lineup! ✔ Clean Energy Boost – Gives me just the right amount of energy without the jittery feeling. Perfect for long work hours and late-night streams. ✔ No Crash – Unlike other energy drinks, I don’t feel sluggish after it wears off. ✔ Zero Sugar, But Still Tastes Great – Love that it’s sugar-free yet still delicious and satisfying. ✔ Keeps Me Productive – Whether it’s chasing my kids, grinding through work, or keeping up with my gaming sessions, this drink helps me stay focused and energized.

Read more | 5.0\nAs part of my fitness regimen, I started drinking Celsius zero energy drink to boost my performance. Since I began consuming the drink, I have observed improved energy levels during workouts and faster perspiration. I am particularly fond of the peach, fruit punch, and tropical pineapple flavors. Considering the cost, I believe it offers good value for money. However, I must note that the drink contains caffeine, which can cause stomach irritation if I consume the entire can. To avoid this issue, I limit my intake to half a can. Read more | 5.0\nThis is the perfect energy drink I will ever get.

Features: great taste, quality ingredients, high caffeine amount Quality: good quality Value for Money: well all energy drinks are expensive, my husband and I should definitely buy stock in this company with how much we drink them so I'd say it's good value for the cost. Pros: high amount of caffeine, great taste, doesn't leave an after taste, doesn't make me feel dehydrated, doesn't leave me jittery Cons: now coffee does nothing for me.

I like that they are free of sugar, artificial flavors, but added electrolytes. They make me feel better throughout the day than many other brands. The cons are that some flavors are not good, and you have to chug them if you need the energy. They can be very strongly flavored. Read more | 5.0\nThis is my adult son’s favorite energy drink. Has one every morning and being able to buy them in bulk from Amazon saves him so much money.  We have purchased multiple times. He loves the taste- rainbow sherbet is his favorite- gives him a quick energy boost with no jitters. Can size is great! Read more | 5.0\nI would buy a case every week as I love the taste and the high caffeine content (no crash) and they help me get through intense shifts at work.  I will only buy them when on sale though because the price fluctuates greatly. I'll wait till they sell for under $20. Rarely do they sell for under $20 but since there's so much price gouging and they are already fairly expensive...I can hold out or go with another brand. Read more | 5.0\nWhat you need to know: The Good: - Crisp, grape-ish flavor that isn't overly cloyingly sweet like the other 'fruit' Rockstars. - Great when ice cold, but still palatable when room temperature. As with all of these, too warm and YECCH. - Decent caffeine. A good pick-me-up pep. - Price fluctuates often, leading to deals. I got my cans for $1.30 or so last time, much cheaper than my local grocery store. The Bad: - Price fluctuates often, leading to rip-offs. Sometimes Amazon has a 12 pack for 35+ dollars, which is very pricey for these. - Taste interferes with food. It's odd, but if I try to drink this alongside breakfast (eggs, oatmeal, cereal) the artificial flavorings really spike. It does not complement meals; drink it alone. I like this flavor of Rockstar best of all of the 'fruit' kinds that are readily available, and would recommend this if you like a somewhat Concordy-grape flavored drink. Read more | 4.0\nGreat flavor, 300mgs of caffeine and no sugar so no sugar crash. About one of the only energy drinks that don’t make me anxious. Good price at the moment, about $2 a can Read more | 5.0\nIf you're looking for a fitness drink that combines stellar performance benefits with a burst of flavor, Reign Total Body Fuel in Razzle Berry is a game-changer. This drink stands out in the crowded market of sports beverages for several reasons. First off, the taste is incredible. Razzle Berry offers a vibrant and refreshing flavor that makes staying hydrated an enjoyable experience. It's sweet but not overpoweringly so, and it has a pleasant berry blend that isn’t too artificial. You’ll find yourself looking forward to your workout just for the chance to enjoy this drink. On the performance side, Reign Total Body Fuel delivers. With its blend of natural caffeine from coffee beans and BCAAs, it provides a steady energy boost without the jitters or crashes associated with some other pre-workout drinks. The electrolytes and vitamins included help with hydration and recovery, ensuring you stay at the top of your game throughout your exercise routine. What’s also impressive is the zero sugar content. Reign manages to keep the flavor punchy and satisfying without any added sugars, making it a great choice for those watching their calorie intake or managing their sugar levels. The can design is sleek and modern, which makes it a great companion for both the gym and your daily routine. Plus, the portability is a huge plus—whether you're heading to a workout session or just need a pick-me-up, it's easy to grab and go. In summary, Reign Total Body Fuel Razzle Berry is more than just a tasty drink; it's a performance-enhancing powerhouse that delivers on its promises. It's the perfect choice for anyone looking to boost their energy, stay hydrated, and enjoy a deliciously refreshing beverage. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\nThis is a fantastic price and every single can was sealed and drinkable, no leaks or anything, however they were all dented. I wondered if that's why the price was good, but i don't think that's it. Anytime you're buying in bulk the price should be a good deal less than in store retail pricing on a single can. But.... I had to wounder... every single can dented? Bad enough for me to be surprised that none of them busted open and leaked. But again, they all stayed sealed. Taste fantastic and otherwise as expected. I've already placed a second order and will continue buying them here as long as it's available. Would be moronic to buy anywhere else at this point. Read more | 5.0\nEl mejor sabor! | 5.0"

Read more | 5.0\nI have been ordering Monster off Amazon for a couple of years now. Amazon is by far the best price and the only place I can purchase a 15 pack of Monster. I have gotten Monster for under 2.00 a can by purchasing the sugar free flavors that are under $30. All of the flavors are decent, I’d have to say I lean more towards the berry flavors with Strawberry dreams being my favorite. But all Monster’s  have a crisp refreshing taste to them. The biggest and only problem I run into with purchasing Monster through Amazon is, the package have been damaged in the past. Very few cans have been dented. I have only had 3 cans ever be delivered that were not full and that was not Amazons fault it was a manufacturing error. These can’s were not dented, no holes were in these can’s, the top’s had not be opened at all. They were simply not filled correctly through the Monster warehouse. I never contacted Amazon about the 3 particular damaged cans or any of the damaged boxes. I did try to reach out to Monster and it was far too complicated to do so. They only allow you to contact them via their page that has particular options on how, what and where you purchased your Monster product.  purchasing a 15 pack of Monster through Amazon are not options. I also struggled with seeing  some of the information Monster requires off the can that is damaged. All in all I would recommend to anyone who drinks Monster on a regular basis for their daily boost of energy to purchase through Amazon. Read more | 5.0\nI purchased the Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango Sugar Free for my son, who needs a boost of energy but can't have the sugar. This drink is exactly what we were looking for! The flavor is delicious and refreshing, with a nice tropical mango taste that isn't too overpowering. It's sweetened just enough to make it enjoyable, but without any of the sugar that would normally be a concern. The energy boost is noticeable, and it helps my son stay focused and alert without any jitters or crashes, which can sometimes happen with other energy drinks. Plus, it's a great option for anyone looking to avoid sugar but still need that pick-me-up. Overall, I highly recommend Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango for anyone who needs an energy boost but wants to keep things sugar-free. It’s a win-win! Read more | 5.0\nI have tried EVERY flavor of Monster Zero Ultra and overall, love this product, love the taste, and love that it's sugar-free and only 10 calories THAT BEING SAID, not every flavor is created equal. The BEST flavors of Monster Ultra are... -Paradise (green can, tastes like green Jolly Ranchers) -Sunrise (orange, tastes like Sunny D but carboated) -Watermelon -Peachy Keen (this one is so friggin good, it's crazy how good it is) The WORST flavors are... -Fiesta Mango! Stay away from this one! It tastes so bad, it tastes like how a hair salon smells when someone gets their hair permed! -Red (It's just not very good, just has a very vague flavor). -Black (Also just not very good, tastes like cough medicine) But for real though, do NOT get the Fiesta Mango. It...is...so...bad! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\nIl gusto migliore preferito,ottimo | 5.0\nVon Monster Energy eins meiner liebsten Sorten, sehr angenehmer Wassermelonengeschmack! | 5.0\n1.0"

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

    "reviews": "ZERO Variety Pack Variety Pack Punch Variety Pack ZERO Wild Strawberry Watermelon ZERO Wild Ruby Red ZERO Wild Berry Yerba Mate Tropical Punch Peach Mango Original Lite Fruit Punch ZERO Wild Ice Pop Love these flavors! Caffeine content just right for me. I only drink half a can a day and it supplies enough energy to get me going on days I don’t have time to make coffee Read more | 5.0\nTastes good, quality ingredients and kept me awake to finish term papers overnight. Read more | 5.0\nIf you're anything like me, you have a busy life, and getting 8+ hours of sleep every night just doesn't happen. You need something to get through your day, and the proliferation of mass-market energy drinks has led you to chugging one, two, three or even more in a day! Not good! I know my own Bed Rull (clever!) drinking was getting out-of-control, and it was having a serious impact on both my health and my wallet. In my desperation for a source of healthier, more cost and eco friendly energy, I turned to my local natural grocery store and found this: GURU Lite. Made with Stevia instead of all those \"let's all wait for the news story about the horrible health impacts\" artificial sweeteners, and containing only ingredients you can actually pronounce (sparking water, lemon juice, cane juice, guarana seed, luo han gua juice, steevia, echinacea, ginko, ginseng)it sounded pretty promising. But what about the energy? Well it works, I took my first sip, went \"oh well, crap, doesn't work\" and then 2 minutes later I was awake! No jitters, no \"surge-o-epic caffeine\" - just awake. It's refreshing, if you're used to the \"wired wired wired wired zing zoom bzzzzz crash!\" of normal energy drinks, get ready for one that actually just makes you feel like yourself. Not wired, not tired, not cranky, not crazy, just a couple extra hours of focus as YOU! But what about the flavor? GURU Lite is best described as \"not bad\", I like it room temperature, you may prefer it chilled. Unlike those commercial heart-attacks-in-a-can, GURU focused on health over sugar-load, so expect a slightly lemony, earthy herbal taste. It is not by an means bad tasting, but it's not like liquid candy, it's a simple, natural flavor that doesn't overwhelm or make you want to chug twenty of them. You drink this for the health and energy, and the taste is secondary. I don't want you to think \"oh it tastes bad...\" because it doesn't, it's just the taste is definitely not the focus, it's not a soda, it's more like a glass of water - you drink it because you're thirsty, and this, you drink because you are tired and want to be awake. What about the cost? Well, Amazon has the best deal around. I chose the subscribe-and-save option and came home to find a box, wrapped in a clear plastic wrap to protect against rain, two days later. Inside was my case of GURU (which looks exactly like the picture). I found with GURU not only am I drinking fewer of them than I did with Bed Rull, but I'm able to sleep better and of course I'm ending each month with tons of cash in my pocket that is no longer being spent on over-priced, junk-laden commercial \"energy\". And the best part? I have all the energy I want at hand in a far, far healthier package. Give it a shot today, you will be pleasantly surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI don’t typically like sparkling drinks. They are hard to drink. They tend to make me feel bloated, and usually they taste terrible because they’re meant to be on the lighter side, calorie wise. For example, Celsius sparkling drinks. I LOVE the non carbonates drinks they make! But the sparkling/carbonation side of them make them hard to enjoy, and the taste is not as good as their non carbonated drinks. If you’ve tried them, you know what I mean. These drinks are also sparkling, but somehow they aren’t as “carbonated” feeling and tasting! Impressive! They have a perfect balance for that effect. Makes it easier to chug when I’m in a hurry. Was also worried about the taste! I’ve never tasted Yerba mate, so I was expecting a very strong earthy taste. It mostly taste like a delicate mint taste with a mild “artificial” sweetening aftertaste and a hint of tea. Seriously impressed. Usually when you see all these healthier ingredients you know it’s good for you, or better for you anyways, but you know it’s probably not going to taste very good. One example of a “lighter” drink such as this one, or similar anyways as far as the use of “better ingredients” in the product, is the jocko willink energy drink. In the ingredients list, you will see things that will make you feel better about drinking the product. But it doesn’t taste good at all. This drink has great ingredients and balanced use of them to give it just enough taste and carbonation, to enjoy. I’m amazed with this product and will buy two more of these cases. I regret not getting the variety packs at sams when they did carry them, because I want to try the other flavors.

The drink is smooth and the flavor is a classic one.  It don't have a bad aftertaste either. I love that it comes in a 20oz can. Most drinks aren't that big.  By being so big, i can set it down  in the fridge and come back to it and be able to have a nice drink to sip on all day!  The can itself is appealing and discreet.  I looooove that it comes sugar free!  Some of the other energy drinks have a poor flavor  or aftertaste in their sugar free options.  Red Bull Sugar Free Energy Drink with 189mg Caffeine plus Taurine & B Vitamins tastes just as good as the full flavor drinks in my opinion. After pricing the energy drinks out there that don't have any sugar, I was happy to see that these were a better deal than most other sugar free energy drink options!

Around that mid-afternoon slump, when my focus starts to disappear, cracking open one of these gives me just the right boost to power through the rest of the day.

I’ve tried other sugar-free energy drinks, but they either taste weirdly artificial or leave me jittery. This one just works. It’s crisp, refreshing, and predictable in the best way. Plus, I’ll admit, there’s something oddly satisfying about that pssst when you open the can. It’s definitely become part of my routine.

Between the cost and the possible health impacts (including the presence of sugar alcohol erithrytol, which may have metabolic syndrome effects), I've finally been seeking alternatives. But what to drink? You start looking at alternatives, and every energy drink is either equally garbage or even worse - twice as much caffeine, tons of calories, or just plain terrible flavor. These V8's have a respectable list of healthy ingredients, a small number of calories, no artificial sweeteners, and only 80mg of caffeine to the 160mg of a Monster or the 300mg of a Bang, which is useful for dialing in and reducing my caffeine intake. They're half the size but only cost a third as much as other energy drinks. They're an easy, smooth, tasty drink that's healthier and more affordable. I'm enjoying them a lot.

I cracked one open, took a sip, and suddenly felt like I could run a marathon, solve a Rubik’s Cube blindfolded, and maybe even convince my cat to stop knocking things off the counter— all at once. The energy hit me like a lightning bolt, but without the crash afterward, which is basically a miracle in a can. The best part? Zero sugar. So I get all the wild energy with none of the guilt. It’s like drinking pure motivation, but without that sugar-induced mid-afternoon nap. I’ve had coffee, I’ve had Red Bull, but NOS? NOS is like if rocket fuel and a power-up from Mario Kart had a baby. You’ll be getting things done that you didn’t even know you could do—like finally cleaning out that junk drawer. Taste-wise, it’s smooth, not overly sweet, and gives you that “I’m about to crush this day” feeling with every sip. Highly recommend for anyone who needs a boost that’s not going to turn them into a jittery mess, and definitely for anyone who wants to channel their inner superhero without the cape.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

It’s hard to describe the flavor exactly, but it feels like a mix of berry and grape with a fun, cosmic twist. What’s even better is that it gives me the energy I need without the crash. I drink it in the afternoon for a pick-me-up, and it keeps me going through work or a workout. The fact that it’s sugar-free makes it guilt-free too!

As someone who leads an active lifestyle, finding a pre-workout drink that aligns with my health goals can be a challenge. That's why I was thrilled to discover the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack. Let me tell you, these drinks have become my go-to fuel for all my workouts! The variety pack comes with four delicious flavors, making it perfect for those who like to switch things up. From the refreshing Strawberry Watermelon Ice to the invigorating Sparkling Peach Mango, each flavor packs a punch and leaves me feeling energized and focused for my workouts. One of the things I love most about these energy drinks is their versatility. Not only do they provide a much-needed energy boost before my workouts, but they also serve as a great coffee substitute or alternative. On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up.

Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to!

They have a great taste. Do not give off the gross and chemically energy drink flavor. Variety packs allows for a nice switch of drinks. Worth the money, would spend close to $50 for the same amount of monster energy drinks. Doesnt give you the jittery feeling other drinks do. Love the health benefits such as the metabolism booster, natural caffine and low calories. Read more | 5.0\nI'm an energy drink lover and really didn't want to like these drinks. I thought they were overrated and not worth trying. I WAS WRONG. They truly taste amazing, the raspberry lemonade is so good. The caffeine content is great, keeps me going with no jitters and no crashing and CLEAN ingredients. If you are an energy drink lover that needs the drinks to function, try these out! Read more | 5.0\nLet me tell you! I've been an energy drink consumer for years and bloom has been a game changer for me! Not only are they the right price but they give me twice the energy boost over a rebull with zero crash. They also taste refreshing with zero fake additive aftertaste which is a big plus because thar aftertaste can get to ya after awhile. I have made the 100% switch to bloom from redbull. Loving the peach mango as my #1 go to with strawberry watermelon as my close runner up! Excited to see if any new flavors come out here in the near future. Buy a case you will not be disappointed at all!! Read more | 5.0\nI am absolutely loving Bloom Sparkling Energy Drink! It’s the perfect pick-me-up with natural caffeine and zero sugar, so I get the energy boost I need without the crash or jitters. The 180mg of caffeine is just the right amount to keep me focused and alert throughout the day. The taste is crisp and refreshing, and I really appreciate that it’s antioxidant-rich—a nice bonus for a healthier energy drink option. Plus, no artificial aftertaste like some other brands! If you’re looking for a clean, delicious, and effective energy drink, Bloom is a fantastic choice. Read more | 5.0\nThese drinks provide me with great energy and have great flavor (peach mango and raspberry lemon are my fav). I wish they would formulate 1-2 flavors with out sucralose (monk fruit ideally) for those of us who are health/ingredient conscious. 180 mg is a lot of caffeine for myself, i wish they had the half can option (like alani nu) for when someone just needs a little boost, wants the energy in the afternoon, or for those who are caffeine sensitive. Overall i much prefer this brand to other brands, however i would not drink them daily due to their limitations. Read more | 4.0\nThis was my first time trying bloom. I got the variety pack and every flavor is so good! It also helps my digestion and gives me a good amount of energy. Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love this variety pack. I recently discovered these as an energy drink option, and I immediately loved the two flavors I tried (Juicy Orange and Strawberry Watermelon), so I wanted to try some others! The other three flavors in this pack do not disappoint! I was worried they would taste like the bloom greens drinks, but they do not! No greens flavor here, just fruity and delicious. They have 180mg of caffeine from natural sources and zero sugar, both wins in my book! Read more | 5.0\nI just love the taste of cherry lime Bloom sparkling energy and it gives me a \"lift\"!

On those early mornings when I need a pick-me-up, I can reach for one of these drinks instead of a cup of coffee, and I still get the energy I need without the jitters or crash later on. The fact that these drinks are sugar-free is a huge plus for me. I appreciate that I can enjoy the taste without worrying about consuming unnecessary calories or compromising my health goals. The absence of artificial colors or dyes is another great feature, as it gives me peace of mind knowing that I'm putting only quality ingredients into my body. The 12-pack variety pack is not only convenient but also a great value for money. I can easily grab a can whenever I need a quick energy boost, whether it's during a workout or a busy day at work. Overall, I highly recommend the C4 Energy & Smart Energy Drinks Variety Pack to anyone looking for a reliable and healthy way to stay energized throughout the day. With its variety of flavors, zero calories, and no artificial colors or dyes, this pack is a winner in my book. Give it a try and experience the difference for yourself! Read more | 5.0\nI will preface this with saying I do not use these before I work out, because the only time I do is at my extremely active job and if I have caffeine before that, I'll be bouncing off the walls! My poor coworkers have seen me make that mistake a few times. Now!! What I do use this for is a boost during school hours. I have adhd, and until recently it was entirely unmedicated, which meant I had to supplement with anything and everything available so I could function like a regular person. I'd drink these slowly over the course of a few hours, and I found their effects to be really helpful in maintaining equilibrium. Taste- Not nearly as chock full of that artificial sweetener taste as I was expecting. The citric acid really pulls its weight here, and the lack of artificial dyes helps a lot with keeping it crisp and delicious. I was surprised at how good it was. It was still sweet, yes, but not overwhelmingly so. Which is saying a lot, since I'm a person with an easily overwhelmed pallette. Energy- Solid 10/10, even over a long period of time. My blood sugar didn't spike, and I never got up to the level of jittery that haunts me with coffee from time to time, and over a few days of having one, I noticed that my energy in general was higher than it had been before. Keep- I noticed no change in the bottles I had in my fridge for months, and the ones I drank the moment they'd been chilled out of the box. Normally with drinks like these, the sweeteners get unbearably strong after some time, but I didn't have that issue here. Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is amazing and good for a pinch before a workout. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is decent, and the 200mg caffeine provides a noticeable energy boost, perfect for a morning pick-me-up. However, the price per can is a bit expensive unless you catch them on sale. Overall, if you can find them on sale, Cellucor C4 Smart Energy Drink is a decent option for a good caffeine boost. I still prefer Rockstar or Monster overall. Read more | 4.0\nCellucor is the best energy drink on the market.  The flavors are great, and just the right amount of energy.  I love the Variety pack, and the cost is reasonable compared to others Read more | 5.0\nGreat for energy, great taste no flat taste & easy for use, came sooner than expected Read more | 5.0\nExcellent product!

    "reviews": "Sparkling Orangesicle Sparkling Mango Tango Sparkling Fruit Burst Sparkling Dragonberry Sparkling Cherry Limeaid Sparkling Blue Crush Celsius is the \"healthiest\" energy drink brand you can buy, aside from Yerba (I know energy drinks are NOT healthy, but I mean- no dyes, healthy ingredients, no sugar, no FAKE sugars, etc. I am a manager at a health food store, and we sell 'em.) I got this entire case of Celsius for only $8... On a Flash Deal... It was an INSANE deal. I never would've tried these, (because I'm not a fan of sparkling water) BUT I have to say they tasted pretty darn good! Not my first pick, but even at full price they come to about $1.83 a can which is slightly cheaper than if you were to buy them elsewhere. The flavor is reminiscent of an orange creamsicle and is very light. My husband and I both enjoyed them, and he isn't a fan of orange creamsicle (unlike me.) There's no sugar as I stated, the can is bigger than the normal Celsius, and they work just as good if not better. I actually lost a lot of weight drinking Celsius and following my Plant Based diet, it helps speed up a slower metabolism. Definitely try them if they're on sale, but before buying an entire case, I'd recommend testing out a single one first of course. Don't commit to a large quantity of something based off of a review made by someone who got a case of these for eight bucks. Would I buy it full price? Probably, but I may choose a different flavor. Flavor is like 6/10. By the way, have you ever tried Ghost Energy brand? That one is a 10/10. Read more | 5.0\nThis is my favorite flavor of Celsius. The price was good for these as it was cheaper than the local grocery store. They arrived quickly and undamaged. These help me get through the day, the caffeine content isn't as much as other drinks so I don't feel jittery. And the taste is good doesn't have a fake sugar taste to it. Celsius is my go to brand of energy drink since it doesn't upset my stomach like others do. Read more | 5.0\nI usually drink energy drinks before every workout, and I've tried probably every energy drink out there. In terms of taste, this orangesicle is probably on par with the Reign orange cream, but this definitely packs a heavier punch. Each of these cans have 270mg caffeine and most of the times, I'll just drink half and stick the other half in the fridge. This is definitely my favorite so far and a must for days I'm looking for a good pump or if I'm just feeling groggy and tired. Read more | 5.0\nThis Celsius Energy drink is great! Make sure you have a supply of it. I order it my the case. I start my morning out with this Celsius drink. It’s reasonably priced if you buy it by the case from Amazon! Read more | 5.0\nWas hoping for a different flavor but this one works for me. Like sugar content and taste Read more | 4.0\nBy far my favorite Celsius flavor though they just came out with a Grape Slush one I enjoy.  Packed full of vitamins, caffeine, and great taste.  Has a little more than a typical 200mg of caffeine, but they energy it supplies sustains for a good amount of time Read more | 5.0\nGreat price, 270 mg caffeine. It did have a sweeter flavor but still good. Read more | 5.0\nAmong the various energy drinks my friends and coworkers experiment with, such as Ghost and C4, I firmly believe Celsius stands out as the superior choice. Celsius is unique in that it has university studies backing its claims. These studies demonstrate that its thermogenesis effect enhances metabolism, and its ingredients are safe for consumption. As a fitness enthusiast who frequently visits the gym, I find Celsius Essentials to be an indispensable companion. Its combination of energy-boosting properties and gentle impact on the body make it the ideal partner for my workouts. I always ensure I have a Celsius with me to sustain my energy levels and maintain my body's well-being. In my opinion, Celsius Essentials is the ultimate fitness partner. Its ability to motivate and energize me during workouts sets it apart from other products. I am confident that I will never find another energy drink that inspires and supports my fitness journey as effectively as Celsius Essentials. Celsius offers a delightful selection of flavors, natural ingredients, and premium caffeine sources. Its beverages are devoid of any medicinal aftertaste. Celsius has truly mastered the art of flavor creation. In particular, stands out with its refreshing, smooth, and slightly creamy texture. It captures the essence of genuine fruits, avoiding the artificial flavors often associated with candy or medicine. I am captivated by this flavor and eagerly anticipate future orders.

All the flavors are great (citrus is our favorite) and the carbonation is just like a soda. But let’s talk about value… so many energy drinks out there are expensive. You can get 12 cans anywhere from $16-$22!!! I mean come on, you can’t beat that!! I would HIGHLY recommend these as your choice of an energy boost through your day! Read more | 5.0\nThese taste like mixing a lot of cotton candy with a little lemon juice and adding carbonation.. but I’m not mad about that. It tastes pretty good. Oddly enough, it has less caffeine than many competitors, and although it doesn’t claim to give me wings, I find it gives me more energy? It’s stacked with B vitamins too though, and that may make a difference. I do notice that my heart started racing a little while I was drinking one of these the other night and it got me a little nervous, but I still finished it and worked my 12 hour overnight shift without an issue. All in all, I think this was worth it. Read more | 4.0\nI love these drinks, especially the blue raspberry flavor, the carbonation is perfectly crispy and so satisfying.

    "reviews": "Rehab Strawberry Lemonade Rehab Peach Rehab Lemonade Lemonade Tea Lemon variety Wild berry tea Strawberry Lemonade Rehab Watermelon Peach Tea Tea + Lemonade I really enjoy Monster Energy overall, so when my roommate wanted to try this flavor I was really into the idea. They arrived quickly with Prime membership and no extra shipping cost, Woot🥳 I couldn’t wait so I popped the can so quick, even room temperature The Monster Energy Recovery Peach Tea Edition was very flavorful and refreshing and I thought of drinking a cold Monster Peach Tea bathing in the warm glow of SUNLIGHHHHT!!! So, I waited super impatiently to try one cold and it was so, so good! Even more refreshing because it was a really hot day even inside. I felt energized but not at all jittery or dehydrated, it seemed to me like a really positive alternative to sugary or super carbonated drinks! I love that Monster is venturing out into so many flavor options as well as varieties to offer something for each persons preference for every occasion and I am super excited about the Recovery Teas, I will definitely buy them again! The price is really fair especially considering they are shipped to your front door without having to pay extra for delivery if you’re an Amazon Prime Member, without lugging the extra weight around and in out of the car is nice, the availability is choice, and it saves on tipping if money is tight for other delivery services. I think you should definitely try them if you are a fan of peach teas and a great cerebral and altogether physical boost with the possibility it will curb major side effects some energy drinks may cause in certain people!! Thanks for checking out my review, I drank them all before I got to the review! Lol!! Sorry for the missing picture :) Have a great Monster Energy Day, I know I’m going to!! (Typically more caffeine than some others in their regular versions, not sure on this one) Read more | 5.0\nAs someone who’s always on the go and looking for a better pick-me-up, the Monster Energy Rehab Tea + Lemonade + Energy has quickly become my go-to energy drink. It's the perfect combination of flavor, hydration, and energy boost without feeling overwhelming. Pros: Great taste and balance: The tea and lemonade blend is spot on. It has a refreshing, slightly sweet flavor with a tangy lemonade kick. Unlike some other energy drinks that can taste overly artificial or too sweet, this one feels light and smooth. Perfect for sipping throughout the day. Gentle energy boost: The energy boost is noticeable but doesn’t feel jittery or overwhelming. It gives me just the right amount of alertness to power through long workdays or workouts, but without the crash that some stronger energy drinks can cause. I can have one in the morning and still feel good in the afternoon. Low calories: With only 25 calories per can, it’s a great option for those looking to cut down on sugary, high-calorie drinks but still want that refreshing taste and energy. I love that I can enjoy it guilt-free. Cons: Larger cans: At 15.5oz per can, it’s a bit larger than the standard energy drink size. While I personally like the extra volume, some people might find it too much to finish in one go. If you don’t drink it all at once, make sure to refrigerate the can to keep it fresh. Not as strong as other energy drinks: If you’re looking for a more intense energy rush, this might not be for you. It’s more of a steady, sustained boost rather than the rapid jolt you get from other energy drinks like Monster’s regular line or stronger competitors. Overall Experience: Monster Rehab has been a game-changer for me. It’s not only a great energy drink, but it also doubles as a refreshing tea-lemonade hybrid. It’s perfect for days when I want to stay energized and hydrated without feeling bogged down by too much sugar or caffeine. I find myself reaching for this after a workout or when I need a midday pick-me-up without worrying about crashing later. Tips for Use: Chill for the best flavor: It tastes best when it’s ice-cold, so I recommend refrigerating it before drinking. Perfect for outdoor activities: The tea and lemonade combo makes it an ideal drink to take with you when you’re out in the sun. Whether you're at a BBQ, hiking, or just lounging at the park, it’s refreshing and keeps you going. --- Overall, Monster Energy Rehab Tea + Lemonade is a fantastic option for those who want a refreshing, low-calorie drink with just the right amount of energy boost. It's perfect for anyone who enjoys iced tea but wants a little extra kick to keep them going throughout the day. Read more | 5.0\nMonster rehabs have all the essential b vitamins it also has coconut water several other forms of electrolytes it has very small amount of sugar some of them are actually juice some are actually tea in Juice. The green tea is the all-around top notch. Best flavor out is the strawberry lemonade it is not over sweet not tart it's just right and approved by my primary and cardiologist as well. The monster rehabs helped me recover when I was going through chemotherapy. I was able to keep my weight up and my energy up and my doctors were astounded by the results of my labs! My primary care doctor actually started drinking the monster rehabs instead of coffee or any other supplements. It boosted my energy levels kept me hydrated where I was not nauseous and allow me to continue my fight which I am proud to say I am now cancer free 6 years.

I love anything that is blueberry, blackberry, or sort of tangy tasting and these are so good and tangy. Second- they are the perfect size. I used to drink rockstars and they were simply too big and I could never finish a full can so it would just be wasted. Because it would be flat later on or the next morning. You can actually leave these Reb bulls sitting out all day and they don’t go flat. Third- the price is decent. They end up being about $1.67 per drink as of this time. That’s not too bad for an energy drink in my opinion. Last of all, they are a slightly yellow/clear color and do not stain your teeth. I used to be obsessed with fruit punch rockstars and they were bright red. I had to quit drinking them because they were staining my teeth. So I appreciate the fact that these are clear with just a slight yellowish tinge and do not stain my teeth. Read more | 5.0\nNot only do they taste great, but getting them delivered is so easy. I can constantly keep them in stock with subscribing to get auto shipments while also saving money! I no longer worry about finding them at a store and getting them home. Read more | 5.0\nRed Bull has been my go-to energy drink for years, and this 24-pack is a convenient and cost-effective way to keep a steady supply on hand. Taste: The classic Red Bull flavor is unique – a blend of sweetness and tartness with a slight medicinal note. It's definitely an acquired taste, but I personally enjoy it. The carbonation adds a refreshing kick, and the 8.4 fl oz size is perfect for a quick boost without feeling overwhelmed. Effectiveness: Red Bull is known for its ability to provide a quick burst of energy, and it delivers on that promise. The combination of caffeine, taurine, and B vitamins helps me power through long workdays, workouts, or late-night study sessions. I notice a significant improvement in my focus and alertness within minutes of drinking it. Ingredients: While Red Bull is effective, it's important to be mindful of the ingredients. It does contain a significant amount of sugar and caffeine, so moderation is key. I wouldn't recommend drinking it every day, but it's a great option for occasional use when you need an extra boost. Packaging: The 24-pack is great for stocking up. The cans are sturdy and easy to transport, and the packaging keeps them fresh. Overall: If you're looking for a reliable energy drink that delivers a noticeable energy boost, Red Bull is a solid choice. The 24-pack is a convenient and cost-effective option, and while the taste might not be for everyone, the effectiveness is undeniable. Just be sure to consume it in moderation due to the sugar and caffeine content. Read more | 5.0\nFull price it's way too expensive online, I usually get this in wal-mart where it's half the price.

We like a variety of flavors, but find some of them they can make our stomachs hurt if we drink them daily, our go to is peach mango (which is NOT what I would have guessed for me, lol), but we like the strawberry, blue raspberry, cotton candy, birthday cake the best, and the purple haze isn't bad, the sour flavors....forget it, lol, my old stomach can't. Bang honestly is the best energy drink I have tried. It doesn't usually give me the jitters, it doesn't usually make me crash (unless I drink the whole thing really fast for some reason or I am having a particularly bad day), it tastes MILES better than anything else sugar free....all the orders have arrived in tact, and I don't have to worry about having to track down an energy drink from every grocery store/gas station like some sort of crazy person...I ain't got the time...I just need large quantities of caffeine to function because of health problems, lol.

    "reviews": "Lo Carb Lo-Carb I start every morning with a good cup of coffee, but by the afternoon, if I need an extra boost, Monster Low Carb Energy is my go-to! It gives me just the right amount of energy without the sugar crash. The flavor is smooth, and unlike other energy drinks, it doesn’t taste overly sweet or artificial.  One of the best things about this drink is that it’s low in calories, so I don’t have to worry about loading up on unnecessary sugar or carbs. It keeps me energized and focused without the guilt of a high-calorie drink. Read more | 5.0\nBy far the best tasting and an excellent deal versus any store.

And I've seen what \"sugar alcohols\" can do to a healthy gut -- I think these (examples of sugar alcohols are xylitol, maltitol, and erythritol) are overdue for a major scandal/purge.....They are sweet and have no real calories -- ideal, right?  But they have no calories because the digestive system rejects them -- with extreme prejudice.  This blue Monster holds down the sugars and the stuff that's awful for your gut. Read more | 5.0\nI love the actual product and they are a fantastic deal when Amazon has them on sale. When my order came, a lot of the cans were severely dented.... HOWEVER I reached out to Amazon and they took care of the issue immediately. As long as Amazon backs their product I'll continue to order, but I would definitely be mad if they came damaged and it wasnt addressed. But for now, all good and a great product.

Read more | 5.0\nPackage broken Read more | 4.0\nI am an avid energy drink connoisseur and have been since around 2005.  Granted at that time there was very little in the market, but out of the three major brands back then: Monster, Red Bull, and Rockstar, Monster won hands down.  The original flavor with the green top has been their staple drink.  But as I became a bit more sugar-minded and aware, I looked for alternatives in the zero-sugar category. Monster Absolute Zero is the drink of choice for me.  It gives that same familiar taste as the original just with a slightly toned down sugar hit.  The drink itself is very different than its competitors, and it is by far the most flavorful out of any that I've tried.  I limit myself to one a day and that allows me to get my fix in. I will say, I don't get \"energy\" from the drink, but I don't from any of them to be frank.  It's about the flavor for me, which is why I still drink it. Anyways, as far as bang for your buck, this is by far the best deal you're going to get.  Sure, Costco and Sams club have the 24 packs, but they don't sell this version.  I was going to the gas station every day to buy one or two, and it would cost either $3.50 for 1 or $6.00 for two (plus tax).  At $1.87 a can by buying this 15 pack, you end up saving a ton.  I buy two at the start of the month and it's just been super convenient to just pull one out of the fridge to start the day.  Sure, you pay a bit more on the front end, but yearly savings for me by doing it this was comes to approximately $400.00 at least.  I wish I would have thought of this sooner! Read more | 5.0"

I got 50+ and my blood pressure was too high. Had to stop.  If your 20s and 30s party and have breakfast and these to wash down. Read more | 5.0\nThis has been a particular favorite between my wife, teenage daughter, and I for a while.  We ended up getting it from Amazon since a lot of local places around us stopped carrying it. It taste more like a fruity drink over an energy drink, and is really nice and tasty when you have it closer to frozen temperature wise.  Very easy to go down and doesn't leave a funky aftertaste.  It is a little syrupy sweet, but nothing strong like Mountain Dew.  We actually prefer this one to the whipped orange, which sadly doesn't hit the nostalgia of a creamsicle bar as I was hoping it would. When we first had this on Subscribe and Save it was $15.99 for a pack of 12, so the prices seem to roughly close to the same.  The value is buying it in bulk, as an individual one of these is $2.49 at our local Kroger, so you are pretty much paying a little over less than a dollar each, which for 12 cans is pretty significant. Read more | 5.0\nDon't get me wrong, I bought this purely to support RockStar energy (I also bought the OG throwback to compare) but the OG flavor was truly better. I remember back In the days (when Rockstar was the first energy drink in the USA) that was my go to. Over Redbull, monster, Nos etc. Then they changed the \"formula\" to what is now called \"original\" and honestly I have no idea why. That made me stop drinking Rockstar for so long, I ended up converting to a NoS drinker then a Monster energy drinker. Thankfully they brought back the OG flavor with the \"throwback\" version and all I can say is KEEP THAT VERSION PERMANENTLY! They really are different and where I'm honestly just too old to vividly remember the \"taste\" of the actual OG Rockstar (to like, compare it to this \"throwback\" version) and I'm not LA beast over there drinking outdated \"vintage\" products just to \"remember\" them lol. I can definitely say that the OG one definitely reminded me of the OG flavor (hence it's name) and it definitely is a different taste than the \"now original\" flavor. So 4/5 I still support RockStar, it was the first energy drink I even fell in love with and picked over all the rest but I just don't agree with the \"change\", hence my 4/5. 5/5 for the OG flavor. Get throw back OG version, Rockstar, keep that version permanent, that's how you get OG fans back to being loyal to your drink over the rest. Facts. I'll be buying plenty more OG Throwback versions. No \"hate\" on the \"original\" i just don't person get the \"change\". I personally prefer/ed the OG flavor. Read more | 4.0\nI love the rock star energy drinks. I love the red one, and this one the gold. They taste good, and they really do give you a good energy. I would have posted a picture of them, but I drank them so quick. I couldn't take a picture. They're all gone, I'll have to order more. Read more | 5.0\nGlad that I'm able to buy this flavor of Rockstar on Amazon because I'm not able to find it locally anymore. The price per can is on par with what it would cost at a local grocery store or gas station. Read more | 5.0\nI love the taste and energy boost from Rockstar Sugar Free—it's a fantastic drink that keeps me going throughout the day. The sleek 12oz cans are the perfect size, and the 8-pack is super convenient. However, the packaging could use some improvement. The plastic wrapping around the pack was damaged when it arrived, which made me a bit concerned about the cans inside. Fortunately, they were intact, but better care during packing or shipping would make for a better overall experience. Still, the drink itself is excellent, so I’m giving it 4 stars. Just a little extra attention to packaging would make it perfect! Read more | 4.0"

Being able to order these makes me feel like Amazon supports my endeavors. They taste amazing too. Ordering these is a great value as well since energy drinks are usually 2 for 5 at a gas station. Read more | 5.0\nThese are some of the best flavors I have ever had when it comes to energy drinks. I am not really partial to any one brand, I drink Redbull, Monster, and Rockstar primarily. The Pacific Punch tastes very similar to the Rockstar Fruit Punch in their “punched” line of products. I think I actually like this one from Monster even better because it’s slightly less sweet, and less fizzy as well. The Mango Loco is very good if you like mango, it has a very natural flavor to it, nothing too artificial. The Pipeline Punch is probably my new favorite energy drink flavor, period. It’s more of a tropical punch, with orange, guava, and passionfruit. I will definitely see if they sell them separately the next time I buy a box. Read more | 5.0\nJust love the taste.

Read more | 5.0\nHello and Good Evening, Seeing as my heart may not take another opening of this can. I must warn the others! The first time I opened this drink I was in the car, and opened it the next thing I know half of the can has spewed and overflowed from the can and onto to me, my car, and my wife. My wife and I were on our way to an all day event, and I HAD TO BORROW A STRANGE MANS UNDERWEAR! Due to mine be soaked, because apparently I was not informed that I would need a poncho in order to consume this beverage. Not a good day. 2nd Can - Thinking that it was just the one can, the next day I go to enjoy another refreshing can in my home this time. As I’m opening the can, SURPRISE!!! Half of the can is has again imploded and started spewing and overflowing in my kitchen. Again. To my dismay, this time without wet trousers. I clean the mess and move on. 3rd can - Thinking I have this figured out. I proceeded  to put the can into a larger cup thinking well if it’s going to spew over might as well catch it. Crack the can and this time it sprays. Like the turning on of a sprinkler. As a Result: I am only opening these cans with the proper safety measures in place. In the outdoors with a cup to catch the overflow to avoid any more SPILLAGE. And a poncho for the splash zone. As a Positive this is well packaged and well shipped energy drink I have bought. This Energy drink in my opinion is definitely the most PRESSURIZED drink I have consumed to date. As I wish to drink these and not strap them to my back and shoot to the Moon Alice. Read more | 1.0\nI wanted to like these because they had some interesting flavors.  Most of them you can’t tell a difference between the flavors.  The sour punch sour apple was awful, I ended up dumping it out.  Disappointing because I had high hopes Read more | 3.0\n***Update: Blue Raspberry Sour Punch is over-pressurized!!*** I’ve tried opening it cold, warm, after sitting for hours, etc. nothing changes. I still have to open it over the sink, with a wide-mouthed cup under it. It’s was an intermittent problem before, but it’s been every one in this case so far. I enjoy the flavor, but this is too inconvenient. All other flavors are great, I’m just going to stop ordering this flavor. I'm a fan of almost every flavor EXCEPT Baja Blast, Kool-Aid, Peach and Tiger's Blood. I alternate orders of the sour flavors (green apple and blue raspberry), a case lasts about a week in our house. This is really hard to come by in my area because no stores keep them in stock for long and the convenient stores mainly carry Monster, Ghost and C4, which are all too sweet for my liking. I've recommended Ryse to my family and friends, you could say I'm an unpaid ambassador! Get a colab pack and try a few, you'll be a convert too.

Thank heavens this is surger free or it would be a sticky mess. 4 stars for experience in the past. Read more | 4.0\nThis is a great, more cost friendly option to Sugar Free Monster Ultra, the white cans everyone is familiar with. The flavor is pretty similar although maybe a touch more citrus flavor and a bit more sweet after taste. I absolutely LOVE Solimo Silver Energy Drink. I do hate typing that because it feels like I am saying, \"my positive feelings rate a 7.6 when consuming Generic Drink brand generic drink.\" Aside from that it is a solid product. 160 mg of caffeine, good flavor, not too much carbonation, and a pleasant aftertaste. Certainly worth a try for any Monster Ultra Drinkers and an out and out replacement for it in my fridge at home. Read more | 5.0\nThis energy drink is a bearable alternative to the leading brands, especially considering the low price. It's definitely more budget-friendly, but the taste leaves something to be desired. While it gets the job done in terms of providing energy, the flavor is not as enjoyable as others I've tried. I gave it a shot because of the price point, but I won't be purchasing it again. If you're looking for a functional, cost-effective option and aren't too picky about taste, it might be worth trying. For me, though, I'll stick to tastier options moving forward. Read more | 3.0\nIt's always a struggle to find cost-effective vices that offer the same taste and kick compared to the ones you're used to, but I was pleasantly surprised by this Solimo energy drink.  To me, the Solimo white can tastes almost identical to Monster Energy Zero Ultra (white frosted can), sweet but not overpowering and light-to-moderate carbonation.  Sweetener used is Erythritol, same as the Monster.  Energy blend is Caffeine with Niacin, Vitamins B6/B12, and guarana seed extract listed in the ingredients. I've heard the red cans taste like Red Bull, but I haven't confirmed that myself.  It's kinda obvious why the cans are named the way they are, but I think they (Amazon) could do with better marketing if they want to reach more than just regular drinkers of energy drinks. All in all, it's somewhat difficult to beat a 12-pack for $18, and 2 cases will get you through most of a month if you only drink 1 can a day.  Also saves me quite a few trips to the convenience store. Definitely give it a shot if you want to save some money, and watch out for the occasional dented cans from the carelessness of the delivery drivers.  At least where I'm at, Amazon is pretty good about rectifying issues like that. Read more | 5.0\nThese are my favorite energy drinks, I prefer the silver, but the red is also good. The carbonation isn’t too sharp, and the flavor isn’t too flavory - shout out to my neurospicy friends who will fully understand this. I think it tastes sorta grapefruity, but not too much. The silver tastes tangy, gives me the caffeine I need. I drink mine in my 40oz Stanley, over ice. Mixed with pineapple juice. Delicious. It sometimes goes out of stock, and that’s why I’d prefer you not buy it. High quality, big 16oz can size,  tastes wonderful. Gives you the energy boost you need to function. Read more | 5.0\nI'm addicted to Monster Ultra but tried this when it was out of stock. Flavor is not the same, this one has a distinct and strong fruit flavor to it, sorta peachy. It's still good, but not the same as Ultra. I still prefer Monster. Caffeine and other stuff seem nearly identical. Photo's show back of Ultra and Silver cans respectively. This is a pack of 12 whearas Monster comes in a pack of 15. When I do the math, they're virtually the same price per can. Given that there's no real savings to get this brand, I'll stick with Monster as I like the flavor better. Read more | 4.0\nThese are very good. I drink an energy drink a day, and unless you find a local deal, 18 USD for 12 energy drinks that don’t taste disgusting is good. If I had to give them a flavor similar to a different brand, it’s very similar to a 1:1 0 sugar White monster. It isn’t exact, but it’s good in its own way. Read more | 5.0"

    "reviews": "I am writing this review for the V8 8 ounce can pack of 24 Prime every two week home delivery, with Pomegranate Blueberry flavor. First, All the V8 regular healthy energy drinks taste great to me.  However, Pomegranate blueberry seems to be the most popular flavor.  I have not met a person yet who doesn't like it.  Please remember though, this is a non-carbonated drink. Most popular energy drinks do have carbonation.  This Pomegranate Blueberry does not. This drink has 50 calories a can.  They typical non-diet red bull has 110 calories for the same size can. This does give me \"an up\" like it is supposed to.  However, I think because  the caffeine appears to be from green tea, it does not have the more extreme up's and downs that other energy drinks and coffee can give a person. So if you are looking to get \"super wired\" for an all-nighter.  This probably would not be the drink for you. Be careful in regards to buying V8! These drinks appear to have become so popular that V8 has released several different variations on this drink.  There is a diet, which has 15 to 20 calories, I believe, but is not nearly as tasty as this drink.  There are carbonated versions, too.  But once again, this V8 healthy Pomegranate energy drink is not carbonated and goes down very smooth.  I have never had a huge belch even when I chugged one. I am currently using the every two week delivery from Amazon Prime to obtain 24 cans per delivery.  The cost is actually a dollar more than purchasing the same amount from my local grocery store.  However, the extra dollar for the convenience is worth it. There often appears to be an extra delay of 2 to three days for us to receive the drinks.  So instead of receiving this every two weeks we seem to receive them every 18 days.  I am not sure why.  Perhaps it's related to Covid.  I would think it is because I live in kind of a rural area, but then again, other Amazon Prime stuff comes right on schedule, so perhaps it is because of something with a specific warehouse or the manufacturer.  If the delays are Covid related, I would think they would go away soon. Read more | 5.0\nFor an energy drink this is far and away from the norm. Tastes like fresh picked and squeezed minutes ago! Just enough natural caffeine from the tea, and not in a giant can! I can comfortably hold it with one hand! 👏 Read more | 5.0\nDelicious Read more | 5.0\nGreat product, great value and most of all the flavors are incredible!!!! Read more | 5.0\nTastes great and healthier than a regular energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI regularly order and drink these V8 energy juices if I want a cold, sweet alternative to my typical hot coffee or tea in the morning. It provides lots of quick energy (don't feel jittery unless I have a lot) and it helps raise my blood sugar to a comfortable level when I need it most. For the product itself, I would give it a perfect 5/5, HIGHLY recommend for anyone looking for a healthier alternative to Monster and Red Bull. However, I have consistently experienced damaged packaging when ordering through Amazon. In a pallet of 24 cans (4x6), I typically have 2-3 badly bent and/or ruptured, which often leaves the other cans sticky and foul-smelling from the spoiled juice that leaks from damaged cans. I advise anyone ordering these in bulk to carefully inspect each one, it's an absolute minefield of not knowing when you'll crack open a frosty can of rotten fruit juice. I have consistently experienced this issue after literal years of biweekly orders and frequently require refunds for damaged cans. If Amazon cannot figure out how to safely transport liquids for human consumption, they should not be shipping these at all. Read more | 4.0\nI love the flavor and the fact that it has just enough caffeine to get me through the morning. The fact that it has vegetable and fruits in the can is a big plus. Love it Read more | 5.0\nI love V8 energy! Pomegranate blueberry and peach mango are the best flavors and I have at least one a day, so I order them monthly. That being said, the shipping packaging/methods need to be re-evaluated.

    "reviews": "Hawaiian Shaved Ice Cosmic Stardust Cherry Slush Breezeberry Juicy Peach These are very good. I mix them in a 14oz  shaker bottle with plain water. They have a pleasant taste and have no sweetner or calories. They also have a pick me up of caffine. Perfict for on the go or I drink them in place of coffee in the morning. Read more | 5.0\nCherry Slush Flavor: The cherry slush flavor is undeniably amazing, delivering a burst of fruity sweetness reminiscent of a classic summer treat. Its vibrant taste and refreshing sensation make it a standout among the available options. With its bold flavor profile, it's sure to satisfy any craving for a deliciously icy beverage. Other Flavors: While the cherry slush flavor shines brightly, the same cannot be said for the other options in the lineup. Unfortunately, they fall short in terms of taste and may not be as enjoyable or satisfying. It's disappointing when the quality doesn't match up to the standout flavor, leaving much to be desired for those who prefer variety in their drink choices. Price Increase: One aspect that detracts from the overall experience is the price increase based on flavor popularity. It's understandable to adjust prices based on demand, but it can be frustrating for consumers who feel penalized for their preferred flavor choice. This pricing strategy may discourage exploration of other flavors and could lead to dissatisfaction among customers who feel limited by budget constraints. In summary, the cherry slush flavor drink mix offers a delightful taste experience that's unmatched by its counterparts. However, the disparity in flavor quality and the issue of price increases based on popularity detract from the overall appeal of the product line. Read more | 5.0\nThis is one of My favorite flavors for the Alani energy drinks but the flavor packet it a lot more tart and way stronger than the cans. Mixed easily win my waters and the price was pretty good especially compared to buying an individual 10 drinks. Tastes good but there's a noticeable difference. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been a fan of Alani Nu's Juicy Peach energy drink in the cans, and I was excited to try the powder version. Overall, it’s a great product! The flavor is delicious — sweet, fruity, and refreshing, just like the canned version. It mixes well in water and doesn’t have that weird aftertaste some powders can leave. My only downside is that it doesn’t pack quite the same energy \"kick\" as the canned drink; it comes close, but I feel like it’s just a little bit milder. Still, it’s a solid option when I need a convenient, tasty pick-me-up. Definitely worth trying if you’re a fan of Alani Nu! Read more | 4.0\nPerks me up every morning just like the energy drinks, tastes very similar compared to other packet flavors I’ve tried. Loveeee this flavor and the pink slush if you can find that one anywhere it also tastes like the fizzy drink. But the cherry flavor is just right. Dunno how there’s no sugar it’s quite sweet Read more | 5.0\nReceived product okay BUT check or ask about date of expirations...as my order expires in ONE MONTH (received in Feb. 2025 EXPIRE in March 2025)  so some packets are already clumped at the end of the tube. And with 3 boxes in the order, I know I  will not be avle to use all of the product before it expires.  Also the taste is not the same. Not a happy camper. Read more | 3.0\nI recently tried the Alani Nu Hawaiian Shaved Ice Energy Drink, and it has quickly become a staple in my routine. Here’s why I’m so impressed with it: Flavor and Taste: The flavor of Hawaiian Shaved Ice is absolutely delightful. It captures the essence of a tropical paradise with its fruity and refreshing taste. Unlike many energy drinks that have a medicinal aftertaste, this one is smooth and enjoyable, making it a pleasure to drink. Energy Boost: The energy boost from Alani Nu is both effective and steady. With 200 mg of caffeine, it provides a significant energy lift without the jitters or crash that some other energy drinks cause. It’s perfect for getting through long workdays, intense workouts, or any time you need an extra push. Nutritional Profile: Alani Nu does a fantastic job of keeping their drinks low in sugar and calories while still delivering great taste. Each can has just 10 calories and is free of sugar, making it a guilt-free option. Additionally, it contains essential vitamins like B6 and B12, which support energy metabolism. Convenience: The sleek, vibrant packaging is not only eye-catching but also convenient to carry around. Whether you’re heading to the gym, office, or just need a pick-me-up during the day, it’s easy to toss a can in your bag and go. Overall: Alani Nu Hawaiian Shaved Ice Energy Drink is a top-tier choice for anyone looking for a delicious, effective, and health-conscious energy boost. The tropical flavor is a standout, and the drink’s ability to provide clean energy without a crash makes it a winner in my book. It’s a bit on the pricier side, but the quality and benefits justify the cost. Read more | 5.0\nMy daughter is a CNA and loves the taste and the energy these give her.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Tropical Taste Pack Remix Variety Pack Mango Splash Green Apple Fruity Flavors Bundle Dwanta's Holiday Punch Wild Orange White Peach Tropical Punch Strawberry Watermelon Pineapple Coconut Frosted Grape Cherry Limeade Super Berry Alright, let’s talk energy drinks. I’ve tried a bunch of them, and Zoa energy drinks are definitely up there with the best. They’re packed with good stuff like vitamins, electrolytes, and amino acids, and they give me a solid energy boost without making me feel jittery. Plus, the flavors are pretty awesome – I mean, who doesn’t love a good Tropical Punch or Pineapple Coconut? But here’s the thing – as much as I love Zoa for a midday pick-me-up, I still start my mornings with Yerba Magic. There’s just something about it that sets the tone for the day. Yerba Magic is this fantastic instant yerba mate drink that’s super easy to make. Just mix a scoop with water, and you’re good to go. No steeping, no fuss – perfect for my groggy, half-asleep self in the morning. Yerba Magic has this refreshing peach mango flavor that’s a nice wake-up call. It’s packed with prebiotics and probiotics, so my gut feels great, and the energy boost is smooth and steady. I don’t get those annoying jitters or crashes, which is a huge win. It’s like all the benefits of traditional yerba mate without the hassle of brewing it. I usually get mine in less than two days when I order it off Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D5YVMX9Q Yerba Magic is loaded with prebiotics and probiotics, which are key players in maintaining a healthy digestive system. The prebiotics, like chicory inulin and apple fiber, help nourish the good bacteria in your gut, making them more effective. This, in turn, supports better digestion and overall gut health. Since I started drinking Yerba Magic, I’ve noticed a significant reduction in bloating and digestive discomfort. So, my routine goes like this: I kick off the day with Yerba Magic to get my head straight and my energy flowing. Then, if I need an extra boost later in the day, I grab a Zoa. It’s the perfect combo – Yerba Magic keeps me focused and balanced in the morning, and Zoa gives me that extra push when I need it, especially during those afternoon slumps. In short, Zoa energy drinks are fantastic, but Yerba Magic is my go-to for starting the day right. If you’re looking for a great way to boost your mornings and stay energized throughout the day, give this combo a try. You won’t be disappointed! Read more | 5.0\nNew favorite energy drink! All of the flavors were good, although, not a huge fan of the watermelon. Has about 160mg of caffeine vs other drinks with 200. Caffeine comes from green tea and green coffee beans. Has multiple vitamins and electrolytes. I wish I could find them in bulk at stores! Read more | 5.0\nI was a hardcore Celcius fan and prior to that a Red Bull fan. But wanted to give ZOA a try. I first tried the Tropical Punch flavor and right away, love it! It doesn't have the weird \"fake sugar\" taste that usually gives me a headache. It's crisp and honestly tastes like a light, fresh, less sweet Hawaiian Punch with a little fizz. And NO JITTERS! It's a clean, smooth energy that doesn't feel unnatural. I love that it comes in a 16-ounce option. My only complaint is the price because it can be pricey at times but it does seem to fluctuate. Cherry flavor is good as well. Read more | 5.0\nZoa Energy is my go-to energy beverage.  I love the orange flavor. Do not like the big price increase that’s recently occurred which is why I’m deducting 1-star. Read more | 4.0\nWill buy again! I was looking for a drink that isn't too sweet, doesn't taste like chemicals or smell like a beer. This is it! The fruit flavor is a little too mild for my liking. But, it's great just the same! I live the variety, the not overbearing sweetness. I like to share new products with my co workers which is what I did when these arrived. I do believe we will all be ordering these in the future. Green 🍏 apple is good. Pineapple Coconut 🍍🥥is good. Not a huge fan of anything peach flavored. But the white peach 🍑is good too. Next on the list is Orange 🍊 , and I am looking forward to that! Read more | 5.0\nNot much on sports drinks but I do like the Zoe flavor original taste with low calories and green tea pick me up. However, I have been trying to buy more orders through Amazone and have had little to no success.  I hope the I can see this product in local Wal-Mart, Cosco, or GMC in the northeast parts of Texas. This product I definitely would like to continue to purchase. Read more | 5.0\nGreat flavor, it doesn’t take like it’s sugar free! I’m very happy I could find the 16oz cans again!

Read more | 5.0\nIt's a shame that Reign is seemingly deemphasizing these 16oz Inferno drinks because I really enjoy this one. The flavor is good, like a bold fruit punch, and I like how it makes my belly feel nice and cold after drinking it. I do wish it provided more of a caffeine kick, however - maybe it's because of my own broken caffeine tolerance, but while these do get me going, they're not as strong as Bucked Up/Bang/other 300mg cans in my opinion. Still, this is by far my favorite flavor of Reign and I wish it were easier to find in stores. Read more | 4.0\nMy absolute favorite all time flavor!! Read more | 5.0\nI’m 96 years old and I drink 5 of these a day (sarcasm). 1 before shift. There is some aftertaste due to the artificial sweetener, but otherwise, it is great cold. Bang is going thru some legal stuff so most of their stuff is unavailable, and other competitors like Rockstar, Redbull, and wimpy Reign 240 mg of caffeine doesn’t do it for me. Definitely worth the money at 23-25. I may go back to the vitamin store and go back to Bang to save $5, though. If you’re a caffeine-head like me, definitely recommend. yeet…!

    "reviews": "Variety Combo Watermelon Prickly Pear Pink Lemonade Pina Colada Peach Mango Orange Soda Orange Cream Limon Lemon Iced Tea Grapefruit Grape Citrus Blue Raspberry Blood Orange Black Cherry Berry Fruit Punch I didn't know what to expect but i was pleasantly surprised at how amazing these are! First, the flavors: 10/10 I got the variety pack to try out different flavors. My favorites are raspberry and black cherry so far. They are so tasty with no sugar free aftertaste whatsoever. Next, the fizz: 9/10 The fizz is very mild, not overbearing. Not as fizzy as a seltzer, just a fine, enjoyable texture on the tongue. Lastly, the energy: 10/10!! Ok, I'm an RN and this is the important part for me. Most energy drinks are too caffeinated and make me feel like jittery garbage then a crash comes later. This is honestly the best kind of energy drink I've ever tried because it gave me a rush of bright, jitter-less energy that lasted from 7a to 3pm, then i had a second one and it had the same effect, getting me through the rest of the shift. No crash, no headache, just a taper off of energy until i rebooted with the second one. I love this product and I'll be subscribing monthly so I never run out. So so good!!! Read more | 5.0\nZipfizz Pink Lemonade is my go-to energy drink! The flavor is light, refreshing, and not overly sweet, with the perfect balance of tart and smooth lemonade taste. It gives me a clean energy boost without the jitters or crash you get from other energy drinks. I love that it’s packed with B12, electrolytes, and essential vitamins, making it a great hydration option too. Super convenient for on-the-go—just mix it with water, and you’re set! Whether I need a morning pick-me-up, a workout boost, or just something to keep me going through the day, Zipfizz delivers. Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nWas leery about trying this.

Always was a pain in the butt trying to score a good deal on them though until Amazon finally started to ship them in these 15 pack boxes. Only certain gas stations would carry them and sometimes I would spot then at Dollar General stores. Walmart rarely had them in stock in my area and most other stores only carried Red Bull, Monster or their own store brand. When I saw Amazon got them, I subscribed right away. Plusses: Great citrus taste, better than most other citrus flavored drinks 160mg caffeine for that nice boost of focus and energy Good quantities of B vitamins Negatives: High Fructose Corn Syrup! Yellow 5 dye for color Cyanocobalamin for B12 instead of Methylcobalamin One thing I did notice is that Amazon has been slowly upping the price of these, probably due to their popularity. Back in Oct 2024, they were $22.50 per 15 pack before S&S discount, latest order in January 2025 was $26.30 before S&S. Still worth it for now, not enough to drop a star at this point.

    "reviews": "Pomegranate Peach Apple Variety Pack A little pricey for tea I'm used to getting for 99 cents, but this isn't your average Arizona tea! It's a carbonated energy drink with a sweet and tart flavor! Pomegranate has a cranberry-like bitterness to it, so if you enjoy cranberry juice you'll like the tartness of the pomegranate flavor. Apple tastes a little artificial, like a jolly rancher. It's far less sour than pomegranate, but it's got a better balance between sweet and tart. Peach is my favorite by far! Ice cold, it tastes like a peach soda! And the tea flavor is a little more noticeable here too! Mind you, I drank all ice cold! And the box is super cool too! Read more | 5.0\nThe tast was good. All the flavors were good .  Energy level was good ,no jitters .They are too expensive to order now, they have doubled the price to $65 that's ridiculous. Read more | 5.0\nI was really afraid it would taste bad like sugar free energy drinks but it turned out to be so delicious that I would drink it all in a day, BUT. There is a lot of caffeine inside, which is good for a full time worker 6 days a week. Double dose of coffee (each 24 oz) doesn’t work for me anymore. This tea made me feel so woken and energized, I couldn’t believe it’s happening. But at 3 am I was still awake… drink it before noon and you will be good. The box it was shipped in is made from a very thick carton, each can is separated from another and secured properly. Cans designed amazing. Read more | 5.0\nIf you collect cool drinks/cans or you’re a fan of the Fallout video games/tv series consider getting this.  The product design is pretty cool.  However, the flavors were just ok.  I definitely think if you’re craving Arizona teas the OG flavors are still the best. Read more | 4.0\nA long time lover of Arizona tea, and I was interested in how energy drinks from them might taste, so I gave this a shot. All the flavors are good - the red apple is very much a candy apple flavor/artificial apple rather than leaning towards a natural or cider like flavor. The pomegranate is a bit more up my alley; it's sweet of course but it also has a layer of sourness to it like a real pomegranate would. If you're not a fan of the fruit you probably won't like the drink, but it's one of my favorite fruits so I really enjoyed it. The peach flavor is super similar to regular Arizona peach tea, but with more peach syrup. The cans are a good size, you'll be peeing a lot if you drink a full one in a single sitting. On the carbonation front, they're not super carbonated. Only lightly, so don't be expecting the level of carbonation you'd get in a soda or anything like that. Made the mistake of shaking a can out of habit but it didn't even explode or fizz out of the can when I opened it. Overall: delicious and worth purchasing at least the once! Read more | 5.0\nAs a fan of fallout, and enjoyer of Arizona Tea, when I saw this, I was very excited to try. The package came in excellent condition with no damage to the cans or anything. They also stayed carbonated, so we're not flat when drank. Honestly, I don't really gain much benefit from energy drinks in general, so I can't speak too much towards whether it provides any effects there. I got this more for the novelty and to try the different flavors. The Pomegranate is my personal favorite! If you're also a fan of Fallout and Arizona, I definitely recommend giving this a try! Read more | 5.0\nI like the pomegranate flavor ok, but the other two are mediocre. The apple especially disappointing because it's such an easy flavor. The can is pretty, but slick. A few times I almost dropped it. I'll finish the box easily, but I won't be rebuying. Read more | 3.0\nThese are delicious and refreshing, but it's a little expensive when a case cost $32.

    "reviews": "Strawberry Start Up Orange Citrus Fruit Punch Black Cherry Pineapple Orange Mango easy to drink, normally a good price, gives energy without making me too anxious Read more | 5.0\nI can't get enough of Mountain Dew Kickstart Orange Citrus! This drink is a game-changer for anyone looking for a delicious, energizing pick-me-up. With 92mg of caffeine, it gives me the perfect boost to power through my day. Plus, it's packed with vitamins B & C, which adds a nice health benefit to my favorite drink. One of the best things about Mountain Dew Kickstart is its lower sugar content compared to other energy drinks. At only 80 calories and 5% juice, it's a lighter option that doesn't compromise on flavor. The refreshing citrus taste is absolutely fantastic—it's like a burst of sunshine in every sip! I highly recommend Mountain Dew Kickstart Orange Citrus to anyone looking for a tasty and invigorating beverage. It's better on sugar and calories than most energy drinks, and the citrus flavor is out of this world. Go ahead and give it a try—you won't be disappointed! Read more | 5.0\nGreat black cherry flavor.  Nice little pick me up.  Nice sized can.  The whole can has only 80 calories.  I wish it had a little more caffeine, it's only got 92 mg.  I have an energy drink every morning.  I keep the fridge stocked with a variety of my favorites this is one of them. Read more | 5.0\nReally Good. Satisfying. Read more | 5.0\nPlease stop packaging them this way!! I adore this flavor and drink. It is my morning “coffee.” I’ve had two whole orders (2 twelve packs in each order) have to be cancelled and returned because they busted in transit. Now, I have an order with a bunch of the cans deformed from smashing around… aka they were 🤏🏻this close to busting also. All of this has just been since they’ve been sent together in a huge box in their new shrink wrapped packaging. The box they’re being shipped in is too big, so they jostle around and smash together. But what I really don’t get is why Mountain Dew changed the packaging??? The cardboard boxes that had each drink in its own cardboard compartment were perfect. Kickstarts have always been known to bust, so the better protection made sense and worked. I get it costs more, so charge a little more or something! I literally buy this flavor in bulk on Amazon because it’s hard to find, and it’s by far my favorite. If I have any of the red flavors for more than a couple days in a row, the red dye gives me migraines. And this flavor has (if I’m not mistaken) the most actual juice content of the flavors. It’s absolutely my go to. Every. Day. It’s not too much caffeine, and it makes me feel GOOD! My entire family swears by “Yellows” as we call them. 😂 We’ve been known to walk in a Dollar General and holler out, “They have Yellows! Get a buggy!” To which the cashier said, “Oh! I wondered what you were talking about,” as they checked out our 20 Pineapple Orange Mango Kickstarts one by one. 🙈😅 I would love to change my review to 5 stars… if you fix the packaging issues. 🙏🏻 Read more | 4.0\nReally tasty jolt that is not always easy to find.  Buy a case for the overachiever in your life. Read more | 5.0\nThey changed their recipe and these things became absolute garbage... undrinkable even. Some can taste like chemicals and literally burn your mouth, others like the smell of rotten pineapple... just grotesque. Used to be the only soda I was drinking. Eh. Read more | 5.0\nI have ordered the Pineapple Orange Mango flavor 37 times over maybe 3 years. I love this stuff. It has only 90 mg of caffeine in 16 oz and much less sugar than non-diet sodas. They're cheaper than sodas, too. At the current price, each can is between $1.50 and $2. That's also cheaper than coffee at many coffee shops and convenience stores. I don't get tired of them. The cans are often delivered well. I've had one instance of significant bending to the can rim this entire time, but the integrity of the contents was maintained. I'll definitely keep buying.

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Tropical Uprising Revel Berry Lemon Elation Enlighten Mint Bravo Mango Bluephoria Berry Lemonade Awakening Orange Peach Revival As a long-time yerba mate fan, I’ve always loved Guayakí for its bold flavors, convenience, and reliable energy boost. But recently, I discovered Wisdom Tea—a sweet tea instant yerba mate that feels like a healthy, flavorful game-changer. Now, I alternate between the two, creating the ultimate balance of energy and health. Guayakí is perfect for grab-and-go moments, though the sugar content and occasional energy crash can be a downside. Wisdom Tea, on the other hand, is low-sugar, packed with probiotics, and delivers steady, focused energy thanks to its blend of yerba mate, L-theanine, and adaptogens. Together, they’re the dream team—Guayakí for bold, fast energy, and Wisdom Tea for smooth, health-focused stamina. If you’re a yerba mate enthusiast, this duo might just redefine your routine. Read more | 5.0\nMy partner loves these! They taste great, they have better ingredients for your body, sugar content isn’t too bad, your energy level feels great and more refreshed (not jittery and all over the place). For the price of these drinks and the ingredients they use, I would say that price is fair. Read more | 5.0\nI buy this exact flavor and unit from the same seller all the time. Perfect for a grab and go caffeine for work. No crash or jittery feeling. I'm a big repeat customer. These are simple, taste great, and arrive quickly. They're on time, everytime. Now I have to buy them more often because my partner loves them too! Read more | 5.0\nI first tried this brand and flavor this last Sunday and I love the taste. I thought at first it was kombucha and I was not a fan. However, I tried it and it was very good. I think if I wasn't so tired or had lack of sleep that I would've felt that difference in my energy. I have been drinking Celsius and I haven't quite felt the difference with that drink at all. So we shall see if this one works. Read more | 5.0\nThis product is delicious and refreshing!! Has caffeine so be cautious!! Read more | 5.0\nI love the flavor and it helps me focus on my day! Read more | 5.0\nReally tasty, and I really like the smooth caffeination that it provides. Slightly more expensive, but the clean and low ingredient number is something that few other \"energy drinks\". There's no artificial sweeteners, which is good because otherwise I wouldn't buy it at all. But they really have too much sugar.  Way too much sugar. They could drop the sugar by 1/2 and it would still be good. In fact, I'd pay more for a 1/2 sugar variant so I can get my caffeine, but not be stuffed with sugar. Read more | 4.0\nUPDATE: As of 02/17/2025 I'd received a very pleasant response to my review from the seller. After explaining my situation, we'd reached a more than fair accord. During the interim, I'd placed faith in ordering another 12 pack, which cake in both timely and undamaged, which reinforced my thought that maybe this was just a one time incident. Thank you for both the understanding and the help with resolving the issue professionally; I'll gladly be a repeat customer of this seller. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm a first time purchaser of these here in Amazon. Price was good and fair, product seemed good. The only reason for the 3 stars is that some of the cans arrived damaged and leaked over the rest of the case and box. I don't typically have to contact a seller but if someone could reach out to me, I'd appreciate it and I'd gladly amend my review. Read more | 5.0"

Ideal for HIIT, Weight Training, Pilates, Yoga, or after intense sports like Football, Basketball, Soccer, Baseball, Lacrosse, Swimming, Softball, Wrestling, Hockey, e-Gaming.

FITAID ENERGY is BPA Free. 3g of Net Carbs. Why do we pick these specific ingredients? BCAAs, Glutamine Amino Acids are the building blocks of protein and are essential to the repair of muscles and ligaments. Arginine and Glutamine help develop and maintain two types of strength: power (for max effort lifts) and speed (for Olympic lifts). BCAAs (branched-chain amino acids) reduce protein and muscle breakdown during intense exercise. Omega 3s, CoQ10. Glucosamine, Quercetin, Turmeric The mechanics of high-intensity fitness training can lead to issues with joint and muscle, thus causing unnecessary pain and stiffness. Glucosamine is widely used for its benefit to maintain healthy joints, while Turmeric and Quercetin can help reduce that common post-workout soreness. You’ll be ready to hit the box again right away. B-Complex, Green Tea. A demanding WOD requires stamina and endurance along with bursts of intense power and speed. B vitamins provide the reliable, consistent energy your body demands during an intense workout, and the mild dose of caffeine provided by our Green Tea Extract supplies the boost needed for quick movements.

    "reviews": "Great taste and good variety of recovery vitamins and BCAAs Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is a little vitamin like, but I prefer them to synthetic caffeine and artificial sweeteners. I feel great afterwards instead of dreading the crash. Read more | 5.0\nI bought a couple cans at my local grocery store on a whim.  Recovery and focus to be exact.  I fell in love with them, so I got this variety pack becasue there were flavors/mixes I couldn't get locally and I wanted to try them all.  They are all good.  No weird buzzes or other adverse reactions and ACTUAL RESULTS.  I can not stress that enough.  THEY WORK.  I used travel aid last week right before we left on our trip by plane.  This may be TMI but I was also a day away from my period and as many women know, that's when we get sick the most easily.  Our bodies defenses are low then and adding a trip on a plane to that mix with all that entails means I usually get some kind of illness when the timing lands like that.  I felt fine.  Had some partyaid when we got to our destination becasue I lost so much sleep due to flight cancellations.  Not only did I not get sick, I felt pretty good too.  I was alert, able to focus, able to sleep and felt much healthier than I would have had I not had these to help pick up the travel slack. My favorites are recoveryaid for post gym or lost sleep, focusaid for when I write or need to be on top mentally, and travelaid for immune boosts.  If I didn't drink a cup of coffee before the gym every morning, I would use golferaid.  It gives energy, but a bit too much for anything that isn't physical.  Partyaid is also good but not something I see myself needing all that often as I don't really drink and I usually sleep fine.  Lifeaid is also fine, but I think I'll drink enough of the others to not need it as much in general. They all taste good, though are best cold, I won't lie.  The lack of heaps of sugar is fantastic and I can not recommend these drinks enough.  In a world were we are all a little deficient in nutrients, these drinks are a life saver.  They give just a little extra boost when you need it most.  I look forward to years of using these.  Just a fantastic product. Read more | 5.0\nDrinks taste amazing and I absolutely love this brand. The only reason I am doing 4 stars is because I was suppose to get the drinks with 40mg of caffeine and I got caffeine free ones. Read more | 4.0\njust to qualify my review, I do not drink soft drinks, other than a cold brew drink in the morning consume zero caffeine, and zero alcohol …pretty much I drink water and decaf ice tea.  The big problem with this sort of lifestyle is that it causes me at least to yearn for some other alternative.  Several years ago, I had found the ideal drink - BrainToniq; unfortunately, that was discontinued.  what came next was several years of trying a variety of “unique” drinks . I tried sugary and sugar free, fizzy and flat, caffeinated and not, and expensive and cheap.  I have to say that those of us who do not drink love in a golden age of Non-Alcoholic beverages.  A trip to a high need grocery, can provide a host of new candidates. After 20+ years of shopping on Amazon, my affinity for the store as well as my proclivity to find what I need and want here, no longer comes as a surprise.  I heard about focusaid from a friend online who loved it.  I searched for distributors and found Amazon, even better Amazon offers it on subscribe & save which makes it even easier.  When the shipment arrived, I immediately tried a sip at room temperature, and then over ice, and I also put a couple in the refrigerator.  my favorite way to enjoy these is definitely chilled with no ice.  My favorite time to enjoy one is the late afternoon. Another caveat about me, I have suffered with ADHD my whole life.  it has never been treated because my parents were opposed.  at some point I came to terms with it and see it has being both a blessing and a curse.  I say all that because focus is an often fast fleeting feeling with me.  So in regards to focusaid bring focus, I am not sure I am qualified to answer.  What I will say is at the end of a day, this beverage does sharpen the mind.  Probably won’t allow you to pass an academic test you haven’t prepared for, but I find the drink to be refreshing as well as calming.  The big thing for me is it has a complex favor that tastes nothing like water or ice tea. I should also mention that this is not an over caffeinated energy drink.  It has a very adult taste to it - I doubt most children and teens would care for it which may also feel like a plus if you often feel like your kids eat everything.  I have heard this compared to Fresca, in some ways I agree, but I don’t like Fresca and love this.  I am glad that drinks like these are available and I hope you will too.

Read more | 5.0\nWhen I went to write this, I didn't think I would say much, but I guess there are a lot of benefits you don't really think about.  I'll really only be comparing the canned Celsius to the powder. At the current time, it's roughly $0.80 per serving vs $1.33/can serving (a Costco case) and up to probably $3 or more at a convenience store. So, it is absolutely delicious. I was kind of surprised the first time I tasted it. With any product's powder packets you can add to water, you can make it as dense or as watered-down as you like (customizable). I put 1 packet in my 40-ounce water bottle because I like a refreshing feeling/taste. In 40 ounces of water, my tastebuds say it's deliciously flavored water, not soda/juice. However, I could see people that hate that taste, and they would just put it in a standard sized plastic bottle to get the ultra-sweet, or non-water feel to it. There are a couple of additional benefits the way I drink it, in my opinion, that tie into each other. Because there is more water, naturally, I am getting more water intake, and it takes me longer to drink. Therefore, instead of getting 200 mg of caffeine at once and crashing, it is spread out over a much longer time period. I feel as though it's a much more sustained energy. And I used to drink 2 cans a day, but now I usually only have 1 (on my non-workout days) because it does what I need it to over a longer period of time. On my workout days, I will still generally have 1 for my workout and 1 for the day which is the same as what I do with the canned versions but the Celsius for the day lasts longer with the powder. I can't really do any of this with the carbonated cans because, for some reason, I just chug them. Additionally, since I am drinking more water, I feel like I eat less. I know caffeine is an appetite suppressant itself, but I am usually pretty content most of the day because I am full of water.  Again, this is in comparison to the cans and I don't seem to get as hungry. I do get hungry, just not \"hangry.\" It's not a miracle drug or anything. Another benefit I just thought about is that it stays colder for longer since it's in my insulated water bottles. I live in Phoenix, so if I am outside in the middle of summer, this is kind of a big deal. The only 2 downsides so far. 1. It seems to be that I go to the bathroom (#1, not #2) as much as I breathe. Okay, that's a little exaggerated, but it's a lot. However, I don't ever have to worry about having to pee in case I get popped for a drug test at work. lol 2. Also, I now carry 2 large water bottles around because I'll carry 1 bottle for Celsius and 1 for water. This leads to having to wash them both at the end of the day (put them in the dishwasher). Again, both of these \"cons\" don't pale in comparison to the pros. I now have almost 2 cases of canned Celsius laying around because I swapped to the powder packets immediately. I will drink the cans to get rid of them but will likely never buy (the cans) again. UPDATE: The use of these just keeps getting better. I am travelling out of country for a month, and I don't believe the country I am going to is big on energy drinks. BUT, I can take a month's worth of Celsius with me (only adding a miniscule amount of weight and space in luggage) and not carry 3 cases of cans, which I would never do anyway. Another reviewer had mentioned this already, but I was so happy I didn't have to worry about my Celsius addiction in another country and wanted to let you guys know that they are ultra-portable.

The powder is easy to mix and tastes great. I've been adding it to my water throughout the day, and I can feel a noticeable boost of energy. What I love most about Celcius is that it's not just a temporary energy fix. It actually helps to sustain my energy levels throughout the day, so I don't experience those pesky afternoon slumps. Overall, I'm thoroughly impressed with Celcius in Powder. It's become a staple in my daily routine, and I couldn't recommend it more to anyone struggling with fatigue. Five stars, hands down!\" Read more | 5.0\nI bought these because im already a fan of the Celsius brand, and wanted to try the strawberry coconut flavor. I dont normally do powdered energy, but I couldnt find this flavor in can form. The flavor of these is better than average, it has a strong strawberry taste for sure, the coconut is a bit milder. Also love the convenience of these little pouches, you can tuck them in a pocket or purse for emergencies. Never know when you might need a boost of energy. I also like energy shots for this reason. Ideally I like a big can of energy drink poured into a foam cup with ice. Then i just sip thru a straw throughout the day and have a steady flow of energy. But these are worth getting, to stash everywhere for emergencies. And the price is very reasonable. Overall I highly recommend these!

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to! The flavor is AMAZING! Energy is AMAZING! And it’s perfect for someone on keto looking for an energy boost! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n3.0\n5.0\n4.0"

Read more | 5.0\nI have been ordering Monster off Amazon for a couple of years now. Amazon is by far the best price and the only place I can purchase a 15 pack of Monster. I have gotten Monster for under 2.00 a can by purchasing the sugar free flavors that are under $30. All of the flavors are decent, I’d have to say I lean more towards the berry flavors with Strawberry dreams being my favorite. But all Monster’s  have a crisp refreshing taste to them. The biggest and only problem I run into with purchasing Monster through Amazon is, the package have been damaged in the past. Very few cans have been dented. I have only had 3 cans ever be delivered that were not full and that was not Amazons fault it was a manufacturing error. These can’s were not dented, no holes were in these can’s, the top’s had not be opened at all. They were simply not filled correctly through the Monster warehouse. I never contacted Amazon about the 3 particular damaged cans or any of the damaged boxes. I did try to reach out to Monster and it was far too complicated to do so. They only allow you to contact them via their page that has particular options on how, what and where you purchased your Monster product.  purchasing a 15 pack of Monster through Amazon are not options. I also struggled with seeing  some of the information Monster requires off the can that is damaged. All in all I would recommend to anyone who drinks Monster on a regular basis for their daily boost of energy to purchase through Amazon. Read more | 5.0\nI purchased the Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango Sugar Free for my son, who needs a boost of energy but can't have the sugar. This drink is exactly what we were looking for! The flavor is delicious and refreshing, with a nice tropical mango taste that isn't too overpowering. It's sweetened just enough to make it enjoyable, but without any of the sugar that would normally be a concern. The energy boost is noticeable, and it helps my son stay focused and alert without any jitters or crashes, which can sometimes happen with other energy drinks. Plus, it's a great option for anyone looking to avoid sugar but still need that pick-me-up. Overall, I highly recommend Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango for anyone who needs an energy boost but wants to keep things sugar-free. It’s a win-win! Read more | 5.0\nI have tried EVERY flavor of Monster Zero Ultra and overall, love this product, love the taste, and love that it's sugar-free and only 10 calories THAT BEING SAID, not every flavor is created equal. The BEST flavors of Monster Ultra are... -Paradise (green can, tastes like green Jolly Ranchers) -Sunrise (orange, tastes like Sunny D but carboated) -Watermelon -Peachy Keen (this one is so friggin good, it's crazy how good it is) The WORST flavors are... -Fiesta Mango! Stay away from this one! It tastes so bad, it tastes like how a hair salon smells when someone gets their hair permed! -Red (It's just not very good, just has a very vague flavor). -Black (Also just not very good, tastes like cough medicine) But for real though, do NOT get the Fiesta Mango. It...is...so...bad! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\nIl gusto migliore preferito,ottimo | 5.0\nVon Monster Energy eins meiner liebsten Sorten, sehr angenehmer Wassermelonengeschmack! | 5.0\n1.0"

    "reviews": "Stoked Island Gold Georgia Corsa Variety Pack of 3 Variety Edition 2 Pineapple MK2 Variety Edition 1 Omni Energy Georgia is a refreshing and effective energy drink that delivers a smooth boost without the jitters or crash. The peach flavor is spot on—naturally sweet, crisp, and not overly artificial, making it an enjoyable sip from start to finish. With 200mg of caffeine and 25mg of L-theanine, it provides clean, long-lasting energy that keeps you focused and energized without feeling wired. Plus, it’s zero sugar and 10 calories, so you get all the benefits without the extra guilt. Beyond just energy, Omni Energy Georgia also includes essential B vitamins to support metabolism, energy production, and overall vitality. Whether you need a pre-workout boost, a mid-day pick-me-up, or just something to help you power through your day, this drink is a solid choice. Great taste, clean ingredients, and reliable energy. I'd buy it again! Read more | 5.0\nTo preface this review, I would consider myself an \"experienced\" consumer of energy drinks (I typically drink 4-5 per week, for the last few years). I have tried dozens of brands and hundreds of flavors at this point, given the frequency with which companies churn out new flavors. Overall, I've probably had an energy drink well over 1,000 times. I'll break this review into three parts: taste, effects, and (surprisingly) design. Taste: The first thing I noticed with all of the Omni flavors is that the literal flavor is not listed. Instead, there is a \"theme\" of sorts listed. The beach scene is called Beach Day, the racing design is Corsa, and the guy surfing on a wave is called Stoked. It seems like Omni is \"setting the stage\", with the flavor supposed to complement the design of the can. I had not seen this before and was somewhat intrigued and skeptical about the concept, but I have to say it works VERY well for me. Stoked tastes more laid-back and mellow than any other flavor, definitely reminiscent of those \"clear\" zero sugar sodas I have tried before. I really liked this one, and I think it absolutely matches the vibe. Corsa tasted almost \"electric\" and definitely had a tart, here-I-am explosion of flavor without being overly sweet, which I've come to appreciate after drinking so many of these. To me, both the flavor and the design are exciting, so I find myself really liking this concept. Beach Day was super bright, refreshing, and probably in between the other two in terms of flavor intensity. I could see myself drinking this one on a daily basis (and yes, I think the flavor represents the design extremely well yet again). Overall, I was a huge fan of the flavors on these, and I like the idea of leaving it up to us to interpret what a \"Beach Day\" tastes like. It's more fun that way and doesn't set me up for misinterpretation of a particular flavor. Personally, Beach Day was my favorite for daily drinking, but I would probably still pick up a variety pack because the other flavors are really good too. Effects: The effects of the Omni drinks were also a big plus for me. I appreciated the fact that they provide 100% of the daily recommended amount of some vitamins in the drink. I like knowing that I am getting at least some nutritional benefit from my energy drinks, even if it's something I may not \"feel\" immediately, like B vitamins or Vitamin C. They also list their Omni Energy active ingredients on the side, which I thought was smart for transparency. I like knowing exactly how much of each ingredient is going into my body, especially if they aim to alter my state (nootropics, stimulants, etc). I thought the way Omni made me feel was great, definitely more focused on mood than ones I've tried in the past. The 200mg of caffeine is a solid amount for me, and I felt lighter throughout the day, which was a unique experience. Looking up what some of these ingredients do, and based on my own experience trying other energy drinks, I think they did a really good job of creating something that gives you energy (since that's kind of the point), but also uplifts your mood to a noticeable degree, without being overbearing or overwhelming at all. Design: The reason I say \"surprisingly\" in the beginning of my review is that I would never normally take the time to think more than a couple of seconds about the design of an energy drink. To me, I care more about the taste and if it gives me energy. That being said, the designs on these Omni cans are really impressive and tie into their flavoring concept. I have never seen an energy drink that puts so much emphasis on making me \"feel\" something when I hold their can. But they do, and that's something I never knew I even wanted from my energy drinks. All of the designs are phenomenal, and you can tell they took their time matching the art and the flavors. There are also cool details on the cans, and you can actually FEEL the waves and the sand. It makes me want to keep it around because the cans look so good juxtaposed against my gray workspace lol. So while I normally would not review the design of an energy drink can, Omni knocked it out of the park on all three aspects. Probably because I also like the taste the most for daily drinking, I would say Beach Day is my favorite design overall as well. I can't exactly get over to the beach during a work week, so it's kind of fun to have something aesthetically pleasing with me. Overall, this is a win for me. Flavors, effects, and design are all great in my eyes. I will definitely make this a regular pick-up Read more | 5.0\nOmni has beaten the competition hands down!  The flavors are crisp and very refreshing! I have let my coworkers try a sample of each and they have ordered their own Omni as well. Do yourself a favor and try them all! I normally would never try anything peach flavored( I also don’t eat peaches) but the Georgia has quickly become my favorite out of the ones I’ve tried so far and I personally rank them as ( Georgia,Pineapple MK2, Beach Day, and Island Gold) They are all amazing and I will still order them all as it is nice being able to keep the palate fresh. Having been a 3 monster a day drinker, I can confidently say one to two Omnis get me thru the day and I no longer yawn and feel tired most of the day. The energy is calm, focused, and doesn’t leave you with jitters, or the crash of other energy drinks.

    "reviews": "Watermelon Strawberry Peach Hardcore Apple Berry Sangria Fruit Punch Always great, its really the only flavor I prefer. Love Rockstar! Tastes great, great quality. Always helps me get going in the morning with the caffeine. Priced well below the stores. Read more | 5.0\nI have been drinking Rockstar Punched energy for years. It has always been my favorite energy drink to make it through those extra-long shifts at work or power through tough workouts. The flavor is bold, and yeah, it definitely gives a strong energy kick if that's what I need. It had just about everything one could want: a bunch of caffeine and a load of sugar, too, which always really gave me that immediate kick. But as much as I've enjoyed rockstar over the years, recently I tried Aura caffeine pouches, and man, they're so much better. The first thing I noticed about Aura is how smooth and long-lasting the energy was. This was because, with Rockstar, I'd get a quick burst of energy, but that usually didn't last too long. Most times, by the end of the day, I crashed. However, Aura seems to give pretty steady energy, lasting for hours without making me jittery or wired. I think the nootropic blend makes a huge difference-ingredients such as Cognizin citicoline and theanine. I have a lot more energy, but also feel really focused and clear-headed, which wasn't the case with Rockstar. Of course, another big plus about Aura over Rockstar would be that it contains no sugar at all. Rockstar is a drink loaded with sugar, and although this may give me an immediate boost of energy, it could often make me feel a bit sluggish later on. Aura is sugar-free and made from clean, natural ingredients, so I don't have to be as concerned about crashing or feel guilty about what I'm taking. Plus, the sour gummy flavor is amazing, way more enjoyable than any Rockstar flavor I've tried. I grabbed mine here https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DF35MFQP Aura is also a lot more convenient. With Rockstar, I always had to carry around a can and make sure to drink it before it got warm. But Aura pouches are small, easy to carry, and require no preparation whatsoever. I can pop a pouch in my mouth anytime I need an energy boost, at work, at the gym, or running errands; it's just so much more practical for my busy lifestyle. I still think Rockstar is not bad, but that's especially if you want just a quick shot of energy. However, Aura has become a much better choice for me: the energy is longer, cleaner, and it helps me stay focused without the side effects I used to get from drinking Rockstar. If you want more than your usual, ordinary energy drink, I strongly recommend trying the Aura pouches-you won't regret it! Read more | 5.0\nRockstar is the best energy drink. They have a variety of good flavors ( fruit punch is the best). 250 mg of caffeine is the perfect amount for me to sustain throughout the day. Highly recommend it.

I purchased the 16oz cans in a convenient 12-pack, and it has quickly become my go-to energy boost. The Fruit Punch flavor is incredibly refreshing, striking the perfect balance between sweetness and a tangy kick. Unlike some other energy drinks, Rockstar Punched doesn't have an overpowering artificial taste – it's just the right amount of flavor to invigorate your senses. What sets this energy drink apart is not just its taste but also its affordability. The 12-pack is priced competitively, making it an excellent value for the quality you get. I appreciate that I can enjoy a delicious energy boost without breaking the bank. The 16oz cans are also a great size, providing enough energy to power through my day without the need for constant refills. Whether I'm tackling a workout or just need a pick-me-up during a busy afternoon, Rockstar Punched has become my reliable companion. In conclusion, if you're looking for an energy drink that delivers on taste, quality, and affordability, Rockstar Punched in the Fruit Punch flavor is a fantastic choice. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants a refreshing and invigorating experience without compromising on their budget. Read more | 5.0\nI love, love, love this flavor. In my opinion it's the tastiest energy drink to be had. I mean, it's green apple and it tastes like it. What's not to like?

Not overly euphoric like a drug... just you all of a sudden realize that you feel like smiling more. The effects last about 5 to 6 hours and fade gently so it is not a sudden drop off or crash... but you just gradually notice that the effect is not as strong.  But the mood elevation lasts longer, in my opinion.  Again, this isn't magic mushrooms and not Monster or Redbull.  But if you like a cleaner energy and maybe a mood pickup... then they are worth a try. Only reason I am giving them 4 out of 5 stars is price... They are expensive, so I only take these ever once in a while. Read more | 4.0\nI was really excited to try the Odyssey Elixir variety pack due to its unique blend of adaptogenic mushrooms and natural-sounding ingredients. Unfortunately, the taste was a major letdown. Each flavor seemed overwhelmingly artificial, almost chemical-like, and lacked the refreshing, fruity profile I was expecting. Despite its appealing branding and promises of cognition and energy support, the unpleasant taste made it difficult to finish even one can. If you're sensitive to artificial flavors or expect a natural fruit taste, this might not be the product for you. While I appreciate the concept behind the drink, the execution left much to be desired. Read more | 1.0\nBad taste. Seems to have positive impact though on energy. Read more | 3.0\nGreat energy and focus drink! Works like a charm, and tastes lovely. I’m not the biggest fan of the blackberry lemonade, but even that is decent! The others are great. Not sweet but sweet enough. Definitely recommend. Read more | 5.0\nI am a fan of Monsters, but I had heard some things about about Lion's Bane Mushroom extract and wanted to try a product with that ingredient.  I tried this product, even though it thought it seemed over priced. After 5 days of drinking 1 a day, I am completely disappointed. The taste of the various flavors is tolerable, not good, but tolerable. What is more important to me, is that I noticed no improvement in energy or ability to focus. Nothing. A cup of tea is more effective and costs less.  I would not recommend, and will not buy again. Read more | 2.0"

It is so much healthier than traditional energy drinks and it has a refreshing taste without that weird bitter after taste of most energy drinks. highly recommend it! I have a monthly subscription now! Read more | 5.0\nCame from an era where cool kids drank energy drinks until their kidneys no longer worked. I'm older now and don't want to experience multiple organ failure so I figured, you know, browse Amazon for options. Since COVID, online shopping was my go-to. Came in a nice thin box holder with plastic wrap. Stuff tastes amazing! A little on the sweet side, so I am sure you can order this without sugar and it would still taste good. The amount of sugar it has is less than your average soda. I've ordered these a few times and so far each package is perfect. No dented or nasty bottles, no defects, etc... The body feel is great, too. Other energy drinks can make you feel wired and are extremely strong. 250mg of caffeine is just way too much. This sports 150 and is the perfect. So I don't get caffeine/sugar crashes off it. Also, doesn't leave me feeling dehydrated too much like your standard coffee would. It's definitely the perfect \"pep talk\" rather than smacking you in the gut and telling you to get running. 12/10 product will keep buying.

It was a bit disappointing that I failed to learn it was non-carbonated but the flavor is good. Rockstar has a great formula for sugar free sweetening without the after taste that comes with many other brands of energy drink. This product did not disappoint in that regard. I like that it has 20% less caffeine than other carbonated Rockstar varieties so you don't feel quite as buzzed. Read more | 3.0\nI regularly buy Rockstar recoveries from gas stations, grocery stores, etc., and they never taste like these ones I purchased from Amazon. They're typically my go-to energy drinks, but these ones, for some reason, taste way off. Like straight chemicals. They're undrinkable. I even had my husband taste them and he said they definitely taste off, like somethings not right. I won't be drinking them. What a shame :( Read more | 1.0\nThese are some of my favorite energy drinks, and are especially handy if you had some drinks the night before.  I expect when you order a case like this and have it delivered, some will be dented a little, the corners almost certainly.

I find that concentrated flavorings (like Mio and Crystal Light) has a strong powdery taste if you use the recommended dilution. I strongly dislike it and don't use those because of it. However, all 3 flavors in this variety pack (Berryade, Strawberry Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade) have the that same powdery taste. Your mileage may obviously vary, but if you don't like the powdery taste of concentrated flavorings, I would not recommend this AT ALL. Read more | 1.0"

You would not buy a 12 oz beverage of this for the flavor, it is good enough to drink 2 oz to get the energy. It is a store brand and does not hit as hard as the name brand but it still works as intended. The packaging and presentation have always been less than ideal. Most bottles have a little fluid that spilled out around the cap and dried. The perforations on plastic safety wrap are too shallow to work and usually have to use a knife or scissors to open the bottles. They are on par for an off brand where you get what you pay for. They work relative to the price and are budget friendly. Read more | 3.0\nLove this product, it works great. I usually drink this about half way through my work shift and it gives me the energy i need to get through the rest of the day. I dont crash and no jitters but i do eat when i take it!

Otherwise the flavors/colors are similar to crystal light, with the lemonade being identical aside from the little bit of weird fizz. Not terrible, but also nothing to write home about. In terms of mixability and ease of use, getting it mixed/dissolved took a little more stirring than what I'd expect. Probably something with the weird fizz. Most of the time I mix it up in a cup in the break room at work, which is fine, but I mixed a couple bottles when I was out fishing and the fizz made it spray a little bit when I opened the cap. All that being said, the 40 pack of these are somewhere between $90 and $140 cheaper than buying cans on the way to work every day for 2 months so there is that.

The yellow bottles/cans contain 200 mg of caffeine and large amounts of Vitamin B.  I have gone from drinking a full bottle to half a bottle before working out and that seems to do the job.

Unfortunately Anheuser-Busch discontinued this brand several years after acquiring it from the original, \"grassroot\" creators. Now it's owned/operated by Tilray Brands, based in NY. My first observation is that it seems slightly less carbonated and less flavored than I recall. Keep in mind HiBall's appeal was its' clean, sugar-free, lightly flavored recipe, along with a medium-dose of caffiene, at 160mgs. (400 milligrams is the FDA cutoff. Anymore than 200 in one day might blow my adrenal system out and induce a cardiac event) But it just seems a little lighter in carbonation and flavor than I recall. Still good, though. Wild Berry was always my go-to. I'm not sure if Tilray is cutting corners on ingredients, or even the aluminum cans, but I will order some other flavors to test myself. In the meantime, I'm fairly happy to recommend if you're not in the mood for the many zombie-piss and depleted uranium-based caffeine drinks out there. Cheers. Read more | 4.0\nCan’t understand why they stopped selling in stores & gyms…  this was hands down the best energy drink ever. So refreshing, no gross “sweet” flavor like other “healthy sugar free” energy drinks, perfect level of carbonation unlike the “barely carbonated” drinks… really great product Read more | 5.0\nVery disappointed in the blackberry flavor. It tastes like sparkling tap water. Blackberry itself seems like it would do well, but the water is so stale that it is unpleasant. Read more | 2.0"

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Summer Variety Pack Strawberry Watermelon Pink Lemonade Peach Bellini Cherry Lime Blood Orange Berry Elixir I like this drink, it has a hood flavor and keeps me energized for hours as I work overnight. I was drinking Alani and would have to supplement with other caffenated drinks to stay awake. Amino lean gives me a good clean energy with no jitters which may be attributed to the green tea. I'll be ordering again soon. Read more | 5.0\nI really enjoyed the flavor, especially the aftertaste when it becomes subtle and even more delicious. The amount of carbonation is perfect, as I usually avoid carbonation beverages because of much carbonation is in them. Those two points are the biggest factors that I enjoyed. The packaging is also super cute and easy to bring with me anywhere I go as it is slim and easy to grab when I’m in a rush. It definitely kept my energy levels consistent throughout the day, without the overconsumption of caffeine. Overall, it’s a great product that makes my life so much easier, and a bit healthier. I use this product as a pre-workout, but more so as a coffee replacement and pick me up because I am a heavy coffee drinker and I always need something new to switch things up. It helps cut down my coffee consumption but still gives me the coffee-effect. Read more | 5.0\nI tried the Berry Alixir flavor and it's pretty darn good. Taste-wise it very-good for a zero-calorie drink. Just a heads up though, if you drink it straight from the can, it might be a tad too sweet so I prefer to dilute it with ice. There are 200 mg of caffeine per can (which is higher than Monster but lower than Bang Energy of respective sizes) Personally it's a plus for me but just be aware that it's on a higher side. Overall, I'd give AminoLean Berry Alixir a solid 4.5 stars. It ticks all the boxes: good taste, zero sugar, potent caffeine, and just a small tweak needed if you prefer it less sweet. Read more | 5.0\nALIX EARLE IS A GIRLS GIRL FOR THIS! I have tried so many energy drinks, pre workouts, coffee, and gum to try to have energy. This energy drink is so yummy ! You truly are paying for the best at a really good price. I keep my fridge stocked with these because of how good they are ! Read more | 5.0\nI really enjoyed this energy drink! I did not experience any negative side effects like jitters or rapid heart beat, which I typically do experience when I have a full energy drink. It gave me just enough energy to get through the mid-day hump and go spend time with friends later in the night. I also have used it as a preworkout drink, and it definitely helped me have the energy to get through the work out. I did not notice a “crash” after. I like that the ingredients are clean as well and not too much sugar. I did not love the berry flavor though and noticed a weirs after taste, so I would probably purchase another flavor next time. Read more | 4.0\nI recently ordered the AminoLean Energy Drink and was pleasantly surprised by how much I enjoyed it. Not only did it taste great, but it also provided me with the perfect amount of energy to power through my workouts and get me through the workday. Regarding the taste, it was very refreshing & not too sweet or artificial - there is no sugar added, no high fructose corn syrup, no artificial coloring. During workouts, I felt it gave me a sustained energy boost, even through the toughest parts of my routine. When I used AminoLean during the workday, I found it to be just as effective. It gave me that extra boost I needed to power through my tasks, and I felt more alert and focused. I didn't experience any jitters or crashes like I have with some other energy drinks & alternatives like coffee, etc. Overall, I highly recommend AminoLeanfor anyone looking for a tasty & effective energy boost alternative! Read more | 5.0\nI like the way this energy drink makes me feel throughout the day. It gives a great amount of caffeine and I’m noticeably more productive when I drink it. However, I’ve tried multiple flavors and they’re all so so so sweet. It’s like they dumped too much artificial sweetener in there. Just a warning for those who don’t like super sweet drinks! Read more | 3.0\nI would’ve never guessed this product had no sugar in it. I’m still having a hard time believing it doesn’t because of how sweet it tastes. The bubblyness and flavor is absolutely perfect. The fact that it is a vegan product and I actually like it is quite surprising, as I usually dislike vegan products because they always taste like it’s missing something. I’m pretty young so caffeine doesn’t affect me energy wise, but when my dad tried it, he said it gave him such a boost of energy that when he went on his daily treadmill walk, he was able to stay at speed 4.3 , level 7 incline for a hour straight! I’d honestly buy it again. I feel like it actually may be a healthier alternative to regular energy drinks. Read more | 5.0"

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Tropical Uprising Revel Berry Peach Revival Lemon Elation Enlighten Mint Bravo Mango Bluephoria Awakening Orange Berry Lemonade As a long-time yerba mate fan, I’ve always loved Guayakí for its bold flavors, convenience, and reliable energy boost. But recently, I discovered Wisdom Tea—a sweet tea instant yerba mate that feels like a healthy, flavorful game-changer. Now, I alternate between the two, creating the ultimate balance of energy and health. Guayakí is perfect for grab-and-go moments, though the sugar content and occasional energy crash can be a downside. Wisdom Tea, on the other hand, is low-sugar, packed with probiotics, and delivers steady, focused energy thanks to its blend of yerba mate, L-theanine, and adaptogens. Together, they’re the dream team—Guayakí for bold, fast energy, and Wisdom Tea for smooth, health-focused stamina. If you’re a yerba mate enthusiast, this duo might just redefine your routine.

Now I have to buy them more often because my partner loves them too! Read more | 5.0\nI first tried this brand and flavor this last Sunday and I love the taste. I thought at first it was kombucha and I was not a fan. However, I tried it and it was very good. I think if I wasn't so tired or had lack of sleep that I would've felt that difference in my energy. I have been drinking Celsius and I haven't quite felt the difference with that drink at all. So we shall see if this one works. Read more | 5.0\nThis product is delicious and refreshing!!

Slightly more expensive, but the clean and low ingredient number is something that few other \"energy drinks\". There's no artificial sweeteners, which is good because otherwise I wouldn't buy it at all. But they really have too much sugar.  Way too much sugar. They could drop the sugar by 1/2 and it would still be good. In fact, I'd pay more for a 1/2 sugar variant so I can get my caffeine, but not be stuffed with sugar. Read more | 4.0\nUPDATE: As of 02/17/2025 I'd received a very pleasant response to my review from the seller. After explaining my situation, we'd reached a more than fair accord. During the interim, I'd placed faith in ordering another 12 pack, which cake in both timely and undamaged, which reinforced my thought that maybe this was just a one time incident. Thank you for both the understanding and the help with resolving the issue professionally; I'll gladly be a repeat customer of this seller. ORIGINAL REVIEW: I'm a first time purchaser of these here in Amazon. Price was good and fair, product seemed good. The only reason for the 3 stars is that some of the cans arrived damaged and leaked over the rest of the case and box. I don't typically have to contact a seller but if someone could reach out to me, I'd appreciate it and I'd gladly amend my review. Read more | 5.0"

They are energy drinks and will give you a similar buzz and vibration in your bones. From personal experience: do not drink if you are dehydrated, the shakes are so much worse. that said, flavor wise they're quite nice and miss out on the chemical taste a lot of canned coffees seem to have that hit in the back of the throat. I have never had issue of these arriving expired, but if you live in warmer climates it may be possible they go bad. They do contain some milk products. Overall, they're a favorite and this flavor in particular is a new one i've not seen before about a month ago and tried it.

    "reviews": "Tropical Life Orange Mango Wild Fruit Punch I enjoy zero or low calorie energy drinks . I saw these on sale and decided to give them a try . I bought a few flavors , this is about the Fruit Punch in particular as it's a very common flavor amongst energy drinks . The first sip gave me an immediate hint of grain cereal smell , a smell that I personally love . It is not carbonated so it's smooth going down . The fruity flavor is strong and pleasant . It's got a lot of flavor going on for only 35 calories . The only slight aftertaste that I get is again of grain cereal and it's very light . I like these a lot , recommended . Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor isn’t fruit punch, bland and kind of metal flavor. Not impressed. I will not be purchasing it again. Sorry Read more | 1.0\nThis is an energy drink that has lots of energy and lots of flavor. It tastes and drinks like fruit juice. The fruit punch flavor was absolutely delicious. Reminded me of the fruit punch I used to drink as a kid, but without sugar. I drank it in the morning and stayed focused and energized pretty much the entire day. Looking forward to trying the other flavors. Read more | 5.0\nI had really high hopes for this one, excited that it is non-carbonated and figured it would be great for mornings.  The flavor isn't terrible and it's smooth but it has such a powerful herbal/vitamin smell and taste that completely overpowers any orange or mango flavor.  Kinda struggling to drink them. I mean it does the trick with more caffeine than most energy drinks, but man that herbal taste and smell just kinda wrecks it for me. Read more | 2.0\nSmells like pee that's been sitting around a while. Taste isn't awful but the smell makes it undrinkable really. Read more | 1.0\nSo this product isn’t bad per se. I gave it 3 stars (it’s more like 3.5), but it could easily be 4 star. I prefer uncarbonated energy drinks but most are lower on the caffeine content, so I was glad to see one with 260 mg for those days when I need a little more oomph. Where this product goes wrong is in the taste which could be a death sentence for an energy drink. While I don’t mind the taste, it’s a little cough syrupy and will easily turn off some consumers. The big problem with the taste is really the result of there being whey protein in this product. It changes the texture and gives it an off taste. Hard to describe but if you’ve ever had a liquid protein drink (think fruit drink not protein shake), you know the taste I’m talking about. If it was giving me 10-20 grams of protein, I might be ok to overlook the weird taste as it’s expected, but this product contains only 3 grams??? What’s the point?? It’s totally unnecessary and I think removing it would do wonders for the overall taste. What benefit am I really getting from 3 grams of protein? All that being said, I still kinda like it and have bought it a few times. And if it ever comes back in stock, I’d probably buy it again. I prefer the fruit punch over the tropical (I haven’t tried the other flavor) even if it tastes like protein cough syrup. I just hope the manufacturer reads these reviews because I see I’m not the only person to call out the protein taste. Take it out and I think you’d have a much superior product to market. But that’s just my opinion. Read more | 3.0\nI bought this for what it does - good energy, plus some protein, and zero sugar - and it does that, so I am happy. Taste is perfectly reasonable. I'm not looking for a decadent cocktail. I want energy, plus protein, with zero sugar. Read more | 5.0\nTastes mostly like powdery protein. Did not like the flavor of this at all - couldn't taste the orange/mango over the overpowering taste of powdery protein. If they left the Protein out it might taste better, and 3g of Protein doesn't seem worth it for the bad taste. Would not buy again. Read more | 1.0"

It's so much cheaper ordering than it is in the store. Read more | 5.0\nThe drink is delicious and I recommend it.  My complaint is with Amazon delivering it to a parcel box instead of to my home.  These boxes are heavy and I pay to have it delivered to my home so not doing so just for the drivers convenience is not acceptable.  Another issue with Amazon delivery is the packing.

If you love gfuel buy this gfuel. I love it. All jokes aside the flavor is pretty good, It's a sweet but just right type of flavor.

I would recommended this flavor for anybody that wants to stock up on gfuel cans or just to try! Read more | 5.0\nI love G-Fuel since it’s no sugar.  I have trouble finding these around me and saw a good sale for them on Amazon.  Buying a case of them comes out to a better price than individually at the store by at least a dollar.  So that is a great value. What I didn’t like is while they are shipped shrink wrapped as shown in the product listing photos, they came in an additional amazon box but when I opened them the cans are all dented.  They are dented in places you wouldn’t expect as well.  There was no leaking and nothing ruptured, just oddly dented cans.

Very disappointing and huge waste of my money. Read more | 1.0\nI've been trying out different energy drink brands/flavors; for some reason on Amazon the G Fuel products rarely seem to have the actual flavor info on the product page.  I had to go to the G Fuel site itself in order to figure out what this is.  Apparently, it's supposed to be \"rainbow candy\" flavor. It is a candy flavor, but it's strange.  If I think \"rainbow candy\" I think of things like Skittles, Starburst, or Life Savers or something like that.  It's not close to any of those to me anyway, instead it's this weird artificial candy flavor, as odd as that sounds.  Perhaps an artificial fruit flavor(s) mixed with a hint of coconut?  It's hard to describe and not what I expected. It's not so terrible that I can't drink it---I hate wasting stuff---but I would not buy this again.

    "reviews": "6 Flavor Variety Pack 4 Flavor Variety Pack - Tropical I started the whole30 this year because of my A1C and being insulin resistant. I ordered these energy drinks after trying others and loved the taste of these! Read more | 5.0\nThe combination of salt/theanine/caffeine is perfect. I am somewhat sensitive to caffeine so I can't do the usual energy drinks with 225 MGs and freaking 200% DV of Niacin, but this is PERFECT. I feel focused but smooth at the gym, I get zero come down, and it's zero calorie. I know buy a case a month Read more | 5.0\nI ordered a variety pack they were more expensive than my normal Red Bull but thought I would try them anyway even with the mixed reviews I read.  Opened the first oneI believe it was Mexican lime it had no flavor at all, ok so next day I try the white peach same no flavor.  Have tried all the flavors in my pack not a fan the taste and price definitely didn't work for me.  If you don't like flavor and can drink what tastes like straight carbonation then this is for you.  I will stick with Red Bull it tastes so much better and the energy was much better. Read more | 1.0\nIt's a rare energy drink without zero calorie sweeteners, and it tastes like a normal flavored unsweetened seltzer water. Read more | 5.0\nI was trying to find a replacement for Phocus water. Was excited to try these as they have caffeine, L-theanine (which helps with jitters) as well as electrolytes- bonus! Flavor was weirdly too strong. Like if you mixed Gatorade into a LaCroix. I mean, they are absolutely drinkable, but I did not love them. Read more | 3.0\nI like how the flavoring isnt overbearing. Its like an energy drink or caffeinated tea, but without the extra sugars. It tastes kinda like tonic water. The cans were super dented the second time I got these, but It was probably a delivery mistake. Read more | 4.0\nTO SALTY! Read more | 2.0\nI’d love for this space to expand. I really like the caffeinated bubble waters but really do not understand why most have sugar or, more often, fake sugar. I wish the price would come down but I’ve kept them stocked for several months now and will do so for the foreseeable future. Read more | 5.0"

    "reviews": "Strawberry Lemonade Original Blue Raz Super great taste the carbonation is not super high so they don't really explode the caffeine content is amazing I will definitely be buying these again I highly recommend if you want a great tasting energy drink that'll get your and your energy up I didn't have any Jitters from this and it was amazing I would recommend only drinking one a day though Read more | 5.0\nI’m at the point of my life where I can’t just wake up in the morning and have all kinds of energy so I was looking for something in addition to a caffeine pill I take right before the gym. I find myself getting tired in the mid afternoon around 2 or 3 PM. This is my first time ever hearing of this drink, and after reading all the reviews, I gave it a shot. I opened one up on a Saturday and drank it around 10 AM. I was preparing myself to maybe feel some kind of jitters or something like that but nothing at all! In fact, it was a nice smooth ramp up to where I felt a lot more energized and focused, but it was not over the top. It’s more like a sustained energy level for most of the day. I highly recommend this drink and I will be putting in my routine order from now on. I don’t think I’ll need it every single day but probably 3 to 4 days a week. I will definitely drink it and enjoy the fact that I don’t feel tired at 3:30 in the afternoon anymore. I agree with my fellow reviewers that the taste is actually really good! That surprised me the most. I had a tall glass with two big ice cubes. Let it get nice and cold and it was no problem drinking it. Great taste and great aftertaste. Unlike other energy drinks that taste like trash. Read more | 5.0\nTaste is good 4/5 Caffeine content is great 5/5 Price is fair 4/5 Recommendation? Yes, I would totally recommend this to anybody that drinks energy drinks often. It is on the stronger side but for the price.. you can't really beat it. Try it out! :) Read more | 5.0\nGreat taste and caffeine but has a high price tag. Read more | 4.0\nThe taste? Fantastic. Energy boost? Unlike any other energy drink I’ve tried. I am not someone who loves jitters & was so relieved that it does NOT give me that despite the high caffeine content. I was very skeptical at first but after about 9 subscribe & save orders later, it’s safe to say I am convinced. I know there are other flavor options, but I found the one i’m sticking with. Try it & you won’t regret it! Read more | 5.0\nThis delivers a real kick when you drink it and it lasts for hours. Read more | 5.0\nDecided to try this energy drink hoping to gain some energy when working out. Really have a hard time with running an needed a little boost. I’ve tried Monster,Bang,Sixstar. You name it I’ve tried it. Saw this had a greater amount of caffeine then those other drinks so I figured I’d give it a shot. Drunk half like recommend to see how it would work. It did nothing! So the next day I drink an entire can waited and waited an still nothing. There’s no type of carbonation the flavor is sweet but manageable. Overall in my opinion I wouldn’t recommend buying this drink. Feel like it was a really big waste of money. The stars are simply based on flavor and the fast shipping. Read more | 1.0\nI loved Brandon loved the idea that I could get three different flavors because the original and the strawberry pink lemonade I think it is I remember off the top of my head are both absolutely amazing I'll buy them on Amazon I'll buy them in store wherever I can find them but the blue raspberry fell short well let's be honest it felt flat on its face it's still a value for the money cuz of the caffeine content yeah it's pop top it's easy to use the cans look cool but the flavor is just not good it's I don't know what's missing this doesn't taste good their sugar-free like  always and Spike makes quality product but they just got the flavor wrong I actually gave out half this case trying to make sure it wasn't like it me thinking it was weird or not everyone thought it was not right flavor and so like I said it appeared to be a good idea it was a good looking package of them but it just doesn't work for me it made for you but to me it just doesn't and it can't get much easier you order it cut the plastic pop the top and go about doing your work Read more | 3.0"

Caffeine content just right for me. I only drink half a can a day and it supplies enough energy to get me going on days I don’t have time to make coffee Read more | 5.0\nTastes good, quality ingredients and kept me awake to finish term papers overnight. Read more | 5.0\nIf you're anything like me, you have a busy life, and getting 8+ hours of sleep every night just doesn't happen. You need something to get through your day, and the proliferation of mass-market energy drinks has led you to chugging one, two, three or even more in a day! Not good! I know my own Bed Rull (clever!) drinking was getting out-of-control, and it was having a serious impact on both my health and my wallet. In my desperation for a source of healthier, more cost and eco friendly energy, I turned to my local natural grocery store and found this: GURU Lite. Made with Stevia instead of all those \"let's all wait for the news story about the horrible health impacts\" artificial sweeteners, and containing only ingredients you can actually pronounce (sparking water, lemon juice, cane juice, guarana seed, luo han gua juice, steevia, echinacea, ginko, ginseng)it sounded pretty promising. But what about the energy? Well it works, I took my first sip, went \"oh well, crap, doesn't work\" and then 2 minutes later I was awake! No jitters, no \"surge-o-epic caffeine\" - just awake. It's refreshing, if you're used to the \"wired wired wired wired zing zoom bzzzzz crash!\" of normal energy drinks, get ready for one that actually just makes you feel like yourself. Not wired, not tired, not cranky, not crazy, just a couple extra hours of focus as YOU! But what about the flavor? GURU Lite is best described as \"not bad\", I like it room temperature, you may prefer it chilled. Unlike those commercial heart-attacks-in-a-can, GURU focused on health over sugar-load, so expect a slightly lemony, earthy herbal taste. It is not by an means bad tasting, but it's not like liquid candy, it's a simple, natural flavor that doesn't overwhelm or make you want to chug twenty of them. You drink this for the health and energy, and the taste is secondary. I don't want you to think \"oh it tastes bad...\" because it doesn't, it's just the taste is definitely not the focus, it's not a soda, it's more like a glass of water - you drink it because you're thirsty, and this, you drink because you are tired and want to be awake. What about the cost? Well, Amazon has the best deal around. I chose the subscribe-and-save option and came home to find a box, wrapped in a clear plastic wrap to protect against rain, two days later. Inside was my case of GURU (which looks exactly like the picture). I found with GURU not only am I drinking fewer of them than I did with Bed Rull, but I'm able to sleep better and of course I'm ending each month with tons of cash in my pocket that is no longer being spent on over-priced, junk-laden commercial \"energy\". And the best part? I have all the energy I want at hand in a far, far healthier package. Give it a shot today, you will be pleasantly surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI don’t typically like sparkling drinks. They are hard to drink. They tend to make me feel bloated, and usually they taste terrible because they’re meant to be on the lighter side, calorie wise. For example, Celsius sparkling drinks. I LOVE the non carbonates drinks they make! But the sparkling/carbonation side of them make them hard to enjoy, and the taste is not as good as their non carbonated drinks. If you’ve tried them, you know what I mean. These drinks are also sparkling, but somehow they aren’t as “carbonated” feeling and tasting! Impressive! They have a perfect balance for that effect. Makes it easier to chug when I’m in a hurry. Was also worried about the taste! I’ve never tasted Yerba mate, so I was expecting a very strong earthy taste. It mostly taste like a delicate mint taste with a mild “artificial” sweetening aftertaste and a hint of tea. Seriously impressed. Usually when you see all these healthier ingredients you know it’s good for you, or better for you anyways, but you know it’s probably not going to taste very good. One example of a “lighter” drink such as this one, or similar anyways as far as the use of “better ingredients” in the product, is the jocko willink energy drink. In the ingredients list, you will see things that will make you feel better about drinking the product. But it doesn’t taste good at all. This drink has great ingredients and balanced use of them to give it just enough taste and carbonation, to enjoy. I’m amazed with this product and will buy two more of these cases. I regret not getting the variety packs at sams when they did carry them, because I want to try the other flavors. Give these a shot if you so t mins a light tasting, light carbonation effect energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI wasted $50.00 on an unsuspecting change in recipe that showed up at my door.  The GURU original use to be AMAZING, now it takes like overly sweet artificial crap.  There was no warning on this change, so BEWARE.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks.

    "reviews": "Wild Berry Watermelon Mint Grapefruit Blood Orange Blackberry Vanilla I like this drink but would love to see more flavors. How about grape, strawberry and chocolate (everything else the same, only the flavor changes)? It’s nice to have a quick organic energy boost option available that has zero sugar of any kind. I wish these would be available even in my local grocery store. Thanks HiBall! Read more | 5.0\nAlthough a bit spendy, it's worth every penny, as  each can is a generous-sized 16 oz and the quality of ingredients is equally impressive.  This lovely vanilla energy seltzer has a clean, vanilla-infused flavor with no aftertaste.  For vanilla lovers, the strong flavor-infusion trumps any desire for sweetness - it's pure vanilla!  With 160mg organic caffeine, 50mg organic guarana, and 50mg organic ginseng, one can will give you energy that lasts for most of the day.  It's definitely a keeper! Read more | 5.0\nI remember getting this years ago and it tasted much better, had more carbonation, and the energy felt a lot more like a regular caffeinated beverage. I don't know what crap they're putting in this new version of Hi-ball energy but 6 or so hours after consuming this stuff I started to feel super flat, anxious, heart began to race, and I became dizzy. Felt similar to a panic attack or something. I can usually consume pretty sizeable amounts of caffeine but for some reason this drink now has made me feel like this 3 times in a row. I will never drink this stuff again because it is not \"clean energy\", it is CRAP energy. Read more | 1.0\nThe absolute best energy drink out there! We were SUPER bummed when the original was discontinued and I was hesitant to think that a new formulation could match then former. The new manufacturer has done a great job! Great taste and without the crash that comes from a lot of energy drinks. Read more | 5.0\nI love that this is just bubble water, a nice flavor essence and caffeine. No weird stuff, no disgusting tasting vitamins, no even more disgusting tasting fake sugar. Yes, stevia is fake sugar and tastes just as gross as the chemical ones. Read more | 5.0\nI used to buy these at Ralph's up until a year or so ago. Unfortunately Anheuser-Busch discontinued this brand several years after acquiring it from the original, \"grassroot\" creators. Now it's owned/operated by Tilray Brands, based in NY. My first observation is that it seems slightly less carbonated and less flavored than I recall. Keep in mind HiBall's appeal was its' clean, sugar-free, lightly flavored recipe, along with a medium-dose of caffiene, at 160mgs. (400 milligrams is the FDA cutoff. Anymore than 200 in one day might blow my adrenal system out and induce a cardiac event) But it just seems a little lighter in carbonation and flavor than I recall. Still good, though. Wild Berry was always my go-to. I'm not sure if Tilray is cutting corners on ingredients, or even the aluminum cans, but I will order some other flavors to test myself. In the meantime, I'm fairly happy to recommend if you're not in the mood for the many zombie-piss and depleted uranium-based caffeine drinks out there. Cheers. Read more | 4.0\nCan’t understand why they stopped selling in stores & gyms…  this was hands down the best energy drink ever. So refreshing, no gross “sweet” flavor like other “healthy sugar free” energy drinks, perfect level of carbonation unlike the “barely carbonated” drinks… really great product Read more | 5.0\nVery disappointed in the blackberry flavor. It tastes like sparkling tap water. Blackberry itself seems like it would do well, but the water is so stale that it is unpleasant. Read more | 2.0"

    "reviews": "Variety Pack Tropical Thrill Son of a Peach Rizzberry and Cream Red Ryder Punch Orange Drizzle Bodacious Berry OG Luck When I performed a search for energy drinks, Lucky Energy appeared as a sponsored result. Curious to learn more, I clicked on it. I was moved by the creators backstory and why Lucky energy became a thing. Upon looking at the range of flavor profiles offered, I went with the variety pack. However, at an almost eye watering $30 for just 10 cans, I was hesitant at first but nonetheless they arrived the next day. Again, love the backstory but also the packaging/design of everything. To me, this is a well put together brand with the different flavors offered and the design of the can. Everyone always asks me what I'm drinking. All in all I like the drink so far, I haven't tried all the flavors just yet but have tried 3 so far and all of them have tasted clean, crisp, and delicious. Not overly sweet like some low sugar/sugar free drinks are with all that fake sweetener and whatnot. This is just right. The only con I can say is the price. Coming in at $3/can is a little higher some might argue. That's what you'd normally pay at a gas station. I'm used to paying anywhere between $1.50/$2 a can when ordering online in bulk. However, at the end of the day this seems to be still a new product and maybe prices will change and times goes on and they get bigger, things get more affordable for them, etc. I can get behind paying the little extra though because I feel good about supporting someone with such a memorable backstory and purpose for a product. I would give these a try if you haven't. Very good and will probably be ordering more at a later date. Read more | 5.0\nMove over Rockstar, Redbull, and Monster. There’s a new king in town, and its name is Lucky Energy. That’s right, I said it: best energy drink out there. And trust me, I’m not throwing that title around lightly as someone who’s basically an energy drink connoisseur. What sets Lucky Energy apart is that it’s made with clean ingredients. Unlike most energy drinks that leave you feeling guilty for what you’re putting into your body, this one feels like a smarter choice. I get all the benefits—energy, focus, and even a surprising mood boost, without that nagging \"am I slowly destroying myself?\" feeling. The energy is smooth, too. There’s no crash, which is honestly a game-changer. I can power through my day without suddenly feeling like I got hit by a truck. Plus, it’s so good that I ended up buying six cases after trying it. Yeah, it’s that good. And the best part? It’s actually cheaper than the big-name brands you find in liquor stores. If you’re looking for an energy drink that works, tastes great, and doesn’t come with a side of regret, Lucky Energy is your answer. Do yourself a favor and stock up, you won’t regret it. Read more | 5.0\nI loved this energy drink, the flavor, size of can and price was reasonable.  Now I go back to buy it again and the flavor is not available in the 19oz can, which is fine because I'm patient and they will restock, but then I see they hiked up the price 10 dollars a 12 pack and the 16oz cans cost 5 dollars more than the original price for the bigger can.  If you find something you like at a great price buy as many as you can cause it's never gonna go down.  Now I can't afford this anymore.  On to the next one.  Happens with everything.  I understand a dollar even 2 but 10.  That's when it's time to move on.  When this happens company's are saying to me, greed is more important than long term loyalty to customer base.  Bait and switch on a lot of products I'm noticing. Read more | 4.0\nThese are my new favorite and goto energy drinks. The OG Luck flavor is really good—not too sweet and no weird aftertaste like so many others I’ve tried. It gives a nice boost of energy without making me feel jittery or crashing later. I like that it has 200mg of caffeine and added ingredients like maca and ginseng for an extra kick. Overall, it’s a solid energy drink that tastes great and works well. Definitely worth trying if you’re looking for a healthier option! Read more | 5.0\nLove the flavor of the organs cream and definitely feel the energy.  Also love the story of the owner of the company Read more | 5.0\nFlavor is okay but has a brewed after taste. Better tasting energy drinks out there for the same or better price. Read more | 3.0\nI dont like coffee particularly but I like a little kick in the mornings so naturally energy drinks have always been my go to. I don't like the high caffeine content of some of them though, there is a such thing as too much buzz. It has a good amount of caffeine but not too much and the ingredients are a lot more basic than others. I like the fact that they use vegetable juice for their colors instead of the nasty food coloring. They seem to be right in line price wise with everybody else. These will be my new go to, from dirt bikes to surfing to work. Read more | 5.0\nOg luck taste great! Taste just like a green monster but with out all the junk monster has in it. You can definitely tell after you've drank a can, it does have a slight taste of the zero sugar but nothing to noticeable after my first can I hardly noticed it. No bad aftertaste doesn't make me jittery and I don't feel like crashing out either. Overall i would definitely recommend this energy drink to anyone willing to give it a shot. I've only tried the og luck so I can't comment on the other flavors but OG Luck is a must try if you like the taste of the green monsters. 4 out of 5 stars because the pricing could be a little cheaper other than that I've seen people complain about damaged cans i haven't had that problem yet my packaging was perfect and was delivered on time. Also this is not a paid review I just wanted to share my experience. Update: Second shipment over half the cans are damaged. Read more | 4.0"

    "reviews": "Strawberry Banana Orange Clementine - Orange Citrus Kiwi Strawberry Dragonfruit Berry Blueberry Pomegranate Peach Mango I bought this product because it was recommended  to help me produce more milk for my baby. This drink, combined with consuming brewers yeast and staying very hydrated has helped me produce 36-42 oz a day. It did take about 3 weeks to build up to that number, but I believe this drink has helped. Tastes great and has few calories and sugar. So as someone who had gestational diabetes, this was a great drink to add to my daily intake. Just 1 a day will get you results. Read more | 5.0\nI’m no expert on sports drinks so I can’t really speak to the ingredients or compare them to other similar products but like so many others, I struggle to drink as much water as recommended and know that I feel much better in every way when I can stay hydrated. My son turned me on to Body Armor and I thought it was delicious. I love sugary drinks and Coca Cola is my guilty pleasure. I drink quite a bit of it despite knowing that it is terrible for me in several ways. I started out with the regular flavors but decided to try the Lyte variety because they have almost no calories for the entire bottle. I can down on of these puppies in a few minutes where it takes me an hour to nurse a bottle of plain water. I’m no athlete but I do work out and these drinks are great at quenching thirst and I’m hoping that the ingredients are replenishing to my body. The Peach Mango is my favorite flavor but honestly I have not found one that I don’t like! Even better, they are reasonably priced on Amazon and cheaper than they are at my local grocery store even when they are on sale. I hesitate to post this glowing review because I don’t want to run out if everyone runs to snap them up. I have the PM flavor on auto-delivery and last night, after reading a bunch of reviews, ordered a few more flavors to have on hand for variety. With Body Armor Lyte I have a beverage that keeps me able to drink the recommended amount of fluid daily while not feeling guilty for the empty calories or spending a fortune. I am a huge fan of this product. I hope they never stop making it and that Amazon continues to make it available at an affordable price. UPDATE:  I just got my shipment of the Coconut flavor and if it’s possible I like it even BETTER than the Peach Mango and I haven’t even tried the Strawberry Lemonade yet. Someone had said these were 40 calories a bottle but it looks to me like there is only one serving per bottle making them only 20 calories for the whole bottle Either way a winner in my book. These things are the easiest way I have ever found to hydrate. Amazon don’t stop carrying these and don’t quadruple the price. Enough said. Read more | 5.0\nBODYARMOR LYTE Sports Drink is amazing! The Blueberry Pomegranate flavor is refreshing and delicious, and it’s packed with natural flavors and electrolytes. As an athlete, I love the low-calorie, hydrating boost it provides, especially with the added coconut water and potassium. It keeps me energized without the sugar crash. Perfect for workouts or any active day—highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nSo I saw the hype about BodyArmor Lyte boosting breast milk supply, and I’ll admit, I was curious. Full disclosure: My baby’s exclusively breastfed, so I didn’t see any major changes in supply, but the flavor? Honestly, it’s pretty good—refreshing, not too sweet, and definitely a better option than another cup of lukewarm water. If you forget to hydrate like I do, this is a solid backup. It’s a nice way to sneak in some hydration while juggling everything else.

    "reviews": "I recently tried the C4 Energy Drink in Grape Popsicle flavor, and I’m really impressed! The taste is spot on—refreshing and sweet without being overly sugary. It’s great to have an energy drink that’s sugar-free, and it still gives me that boost I need for my workouts. What I love the most is that there’s no crash after the energy kicks in. It helps me stay focused and energized throughout my training without the sudden drop in energy that some drinks cause. If you’re looking for a great-tasting, effective pre-workout drink with no sugar and no crash, this one’s definitely worth trying! Read more | 5.0\nI absolutely love these. They taste great and you can sip on it all day, without crashing (I drink two a day and sometimes never finish the second one). Truly see an energy increase without jitters. The price is great in amazon! I wouldn’t say I have experienced any cons with this product. Skittle flavor is one of my favorites. I even got people at work drinking them, daycare is a very high energy demanding job. Thankful for this energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nThis really helped my husband focus during his 12 hour night shifts!  He LOVES the taste of it!  The caffeine content is perfect that doesn't cause any jitteriness.  The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar. The watermelon taste is spot on, refreshing with just the right amount of sweetness. The Beta-Alanine helps with endurance, and it keeps me energized throughout my workout. Convenient, effective, and delicious – highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nThe superior energy drink! I have tried all the C4 products., and I gotta say love most! But this is above all else my go to! The flavor is AMAZING! Energy is AMAZING! And it’s perfect for someone on keto looking for an energy boost! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n5.0\n1.0\n4.0"

Read more | 4.0\nEver since I discovered these energy drinks, they have become a part of every morning. I don’t feel that I need to have one, like coffee, or other stimulant type of caffeine drink. I just like the taste, and the way that it energizes and starts my morning. One issue to be aware of of course is the fact that five hour energy does contain niacin. That’s not a bad thing. It’s just important to note that you should not drink the entire bottle all at once, particularly if you have had any type of low blood blood pressure problem  in the past, or you are taking medication for blood pressure. The niacin may cause a niacin rush as it is known and this may make you feel a little faint. Some people have actually reported that they drank the entire bottle and then fainted for a moment onto the floor.  The bottle itself warns against this and does indicate that you should not drink the entire bottle all at once. For me, I break it up into three parts I take a drink and then perhaps get dressed or take a shower then I drink another third, and perhaps read the daily newspaper  or answer email and then by the time I get into the car after about 30 or 40 minutes I drink the final third of the bottle. That is perfect for me no effects no dizziness and I am fully energized for the morning some of the flavors are not real wonderful, so choose the one that you like the best. For me it is the berry.

Khaotic, Pipeline Punch, Pacific Punch, etc? Are you curious to know if this is worth your time and money? Well rest easy friend, I’m here to tell you all about Rio Punch! It’s fine. There it is. It’s perfectly serviceable. It does not have a bad taste or an after taste in my opinion. But compared to those other juice monsters, which are sweet and have a very pronounced taste, Rio Punch just is. My wife said it tasted like a stale tangerine. I kind of agree, but not in a bad stale tangerine kind of way. I kind of feel it tastes like a slightly sweetened water with fizz. In conclusion, if the prices are out of control, as they usually are, and you need your monster, and Rio Punch is a lower price, it will work just fine. Just don’t expect to be blown away. And it is better than Aussie Lemonade. So there’s that. Read more | 4.0\nLove the taste Read more | 5.0\nIts sweet and fruity and when allowed to get cold the fruit flavor is multiplied.

    "reviews": "Strawberry Watermelon Glacier Freeze 3-Flavor Variety Pack Cool Blue I’ve had close to 60 orders of 24-pack redbulls from Amazon on every two weeks delivery for a long time now. I work shift work and live on caffeine. A coworker had some of these and I tried it out. Little to no sugar, 200mg caffine vs 120mg and a great refreshing taste to boot! I now have had 6 deliveries of these on two week auto order. I’m a big fan of these. I miss my redbulls taste, but these are a better alternative for long term users like myself. I will say, the orange is not my favorite. But this pack is best priced most competitive. Read more | 5.0\nIn my opinion these are the best energy drink out there currently. I don’t have a lot of time in the mornings to sip a carbonated energy drink or make coffee, so grabbing one of these and being able to drink it quickly while I’m driving to work is a huge win. I don’t feel sick after drinking it and it doesn’t give me digestive issues either. I love that these also use natural color sources for the food coloring- the glacier freeze uses blueberry juice which also tastes great too. I can’t find them in stores near me anymore so I always order them through here. Read more | 5.0\nI tried several of the flavors when they hit the store and found myself buying a couple every time I went so I finally ordered a case. The Strawberry Watermelon is my favorite but some people may find them on the sweet/syrupy tasting side. The energy you get though (200MG Caffeine) is clean as there's no sugar in this drink to make you crash. Low calorie and low sodium is great too. Not all drinks are created equal, I've tried some brands that advertise 300MG of caffeine in the drink and however it's formulated, you just don't feel it. You do with this drink though, I drink it in the morning before the gym most days and it gives me a good amount of energy without some side affects traditional pre-workouts can have. I also like that it's a little bottle VS a can that way if I am in the car or carrying it to the gym and it's already opened I don't have to worry about spilling it, however because of that design it does not stay cold as long. Definitely going to be my go to drink for awhile! Read more | 5.0\nI'm not a coffee drinker, and I don't love carbonated drinks in the AM.  Gatorade Fast Twitch gives me my morning caffeine and tastes delicious in the process.  My favorite flavors are grape and strawberry watermelon. I had a really hard time with Celcius making me dizzy, and Monster making me really shaky, but Fast Twitch has a nice smooth delivery of the caffeine and is ridiculously easy to drink. I love it before an afternoon of pickleball just to get that extra edge. Read more | 5.0\nI ordered this product a little over a week ago for $15.98.  within that little bit of time I returned to place another order and the price increased by $7 and now costs $22.98. how did the product increase price by 50% in that short of time? While the product is good, it is way overpriced. These bottles are only 12 oz each and not worth almost $2 per bottle.  Lower the price and I will continue to buy. As for now, the product tasted good but the price increase left a bad taste in my mouth Read more | 4.0\nI never bothered with energy drinks.  I was always a Dr Pepper girl, but wanted to find an option for some mid-day energy without all the calories.  I started looking around to see what was out there, and saw this non-carbonated option that had a few flavors that I may potentially like.  I found a local place where I could buy single bottles and tried both the Strawberry Watermelon (my two favorite fruit flavors combined into one - a rare find!) and Strawberry Lemonade.  The Strawberry Lemonade one wasn't bad, but I loved the Strawberry Watermelon flavor right away and have been ordering these cases of it ever since. Read more | 5.0\nThis is by far the best energy drink ever made.  Unfortunately it's discontinued Read more | 5.0\nThese taste just like regular Gatorade which is impressive considering the 0 sugar! But weirdly they still have the same syrupy sugar feel and taste that the regular drinks do as well. My husband likes the flavor but can only handle it in small amounts because of the intense syrupy taste and how it coats your mouth. Personally I don't mind it! A big positive is the caffeine and B6/B12 boost without carbonation. These really do get us through the day as well as any other energy drink we've tried and it's very nice to have an option that isn't carbonated. A big negative is that a lot (not all) of the caps are EXTREMELY difficult to get off. And not just a perforation issue, but even once perforated from the ring, the caps still won't turn because they are so tight. I've never had to do battle with a regular Gatorade bottle to get it open, so I'm not sure what's going on with these. Overall, I would give these 4 stars and my husband would give them a 2, so rounding to a 3 stars! I think it would be an easy 4 stars if we didn't have to STRUGGLE with half the bottles just to drink them. (my palm is currently red and sore from trying repeatedly to get one bottle open that I eventually put back in the fridge for my husband to deal with, so I'm a little salty over the stupid caps atm).

    "reviews": "Tropical Punch Strawberry Grape Strawberry Banana Pineapple Coconut Orange Mango Fruit Punch Cherry Lime Blue Raspberry Blackout Berry I recently tried the BODYARMOR Sports Drink, Tropical Punch flavor, and it quickly became a staple in my daily routine. This drink not only tastes great with its tropical flavors, but it also provides incredible hydration benefits, thanks to the coconut water and a blend of vitamins and potassium-packed electrolytes. As a breastfeeding mom, hydration is crucial, and I've found that BODYARMOR significantly supports my milk supply. The combination of nutrients and electrolytes helps keep me hydrated throughout the day, which is vital for maintaining and boosting milk production. I appreciate that this drink is formulated free from artificial additives, making it a much better choice compared to many other sports drinks on the market. The 16 Fl Oz bottle size is perfect for on-the-go hydration, and the pack of 12 ensures that I always have a refreshing drink available when I need it. Whether I'm at home, out running errands, or taking a walk with the baby, BODYARMOR has been a reliable companion when I’m bored with drinking plain water. I recommend at least trying this for breastfeeding moms looking for a great tasting and effective way to stay hydrated and support their milk supply.

And delicious,  requested and liked by daughter and family Read more | 5.0\nGreat price instead of buying one by one at the gas station. My partner came out of the hospital and was advised by his Dr to get something in order to stay well hydrated. We both loved these and have now subscribed. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve always been a fan of Body Armors and the different types of flavors they released, my top favorites being between Blue Raspberry, Strawberry Banana, and Blackout Berry which all fight for first place! This time around, I purchased myself a case of Blue Raspberry and was more than pleased when it had arrived. There was zero damage, tampering, nor any issues present with the bottles or the case itself, as well as being just as I had expected it. I’ve never ordered them online though, so the quantity I received for the price I bought them at was well worth it due to it being significantly cheaper, by a long shot, on Amazon then what it is in stores. The one thing to always remind yourself of though since it’s a sports drink is that it contains a lot of things from vitamins to electrolytes. So it’s definitely recommended to not drink heavy amounts of it even if you have a lot, as some nauseating side effects like headaches, slight stomach sickness, as well as throat irritation can occur. Overall? It’s a really great product I see myself getting in large quantities again through Amazon rather than in-person stores because of the better pricing as well as accessible variety in stock. Being something I’d recommend as well to others who may be interested in something with good flavors as well as benefits. The one thing I wish is that I could find more like it, such as Strawberry Banana, minus all of the electrolytes and factors that force your hand in not drinking so much. As there are many different brands with the same flavor in mind, but they don’t hit that exact mark that I look for that Body Armors do. Read more | 4.0\nUse to be a Gatorade drinker switched to this when my friend started working for them and he would bring them to our softball games and have not ever thought about switching back.  Great taste and less added sugars.  I try to but them when they go on sale you use to be able to get the 20oz 6 pack at a $1 a bottle now that is harder to find so usually you can get the 16oz 12 pack for $1 a bottle Read more | 5.0\nLove all the fun flavors! The coconut water is the best in keeping you naturally hydrated. Body Armour was one of the few drinks I could find that didn’t have fake sugars. Read more | 5.0"

One caveat: Although it is a low calorie beverage with no sugar, this drink is not recommended if you are diabetic due to the high glycemic index of Maltodextrin an ingredient listed on this drink. Otherwise, enjoy! This is delicious! Read more | 4.0\nThis seltzer offers a refreshing, light taste with a subtle hint of natural fruit flavor that isn’t overpowering or artificial. The carbonation is crisp and delivers a pleasant fizz without being too intense, making it easy to drink. With no added sugars or sweeteners, it’s a great zero-calorie option for those looking to stay hydrated without the heaviness of sugary drinks. Overall, it’s a well-balanced, versatile seltzer that works perfectly on its own or as a mixer in cocktails, providing a clean and satisfying experience. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been loving this peach-flavored Gutsy Seltzer  and it’s quickly become my go-to while reading by the pool, lounging in the sun, or even after a swim. 🏊‍♀️🍑 What sets it apart? It’s packed with probiotics, prebiotics, and Vitamin B3—all great for supporting gut health, which is a huge plus for me since I struggle with stomach issues. 🙌 Low in sugar, low in calories, and caffeine-free, this seltzer is the ideal guilt-free drink to sip on while chilling out. 💧 Perfectly refreshing with just the right amount of fizz, this sparkling water is a must-try if you’re looking for something light, tasty, and good for your body. 🌿✨ Read more | 5.0\nAll good excepted they doubled the price in less than 30 days. Product and taste is good. A light daily adaptageb drink. Used to buy these at $16, now $39 ($34) with discount. Idk what's happend, but supply demand right? If it went to $19 or even eventually $24. Not strong enough to make a difference to be $39. $19 seems to be fair. Read more | 3.0\nYummy! Much better than soda! Read more | 4.0"

    "reviews": "My dad has been on the hunt for something to give him a bit more energy lately, so I ordered these with him in mind. I decided to be the guinea pig first to see if anything would actually happen and below is my full experience thus far. I received these Monday the 16th and by the time I took the first half of a bottle I had already been awake for 18hours. I figured being on the verge of when normal people would be getting ready to sleep would be a perfect trial for this. The taste is a bit medicinal but fruity and still surprisingly pretty easy to shoot back. Within the first 15 minutes I noticed I did feel more awake than I was before I took it, but I wasn't highly alert or \"all hopped up on Mountain Dew\" and bouncing off the walls. I went back to working on the project I was doing before I took it and noticed that maybe about 4 hours in I was starting to feel sleepy for a moment, but realized it was simply do to my posture while I was sitting, once I adjusted I was back to the same level I had prior. I have a bad habit that it doesn't matter how awake I am, if I find just that perfect little spot/level of comfort I'll pass out lol. About 3-4 more hours later I decided to give the other half a shot to see if it would do anything or if I'd finally pass out. I stayed awake.... All in all I managed to stay up for 38 hours before finally decided to fall asleep, 20 hours of it was due to the shot. Caving on sleep was definitely allowing myself to get too comfortable again in how I was sitting or I think I would've still stayed up had I gotten up and moved to work on something else. I ended up drifting off peacefully instead of crashing hard or feeling super sleepy and deciding to go to bed. It was a lovely solid 12 hours of sleep though lol. While taking it I never experienced any headaches, nausea, jitters, or over active energy or high alertness. It was a nice even keeled experience that let me continue working like I wanted, like keeping a smidge above a good midday energy level for the entire day instead of just wanting a nap every 3 hours lol. When I slept I felt peaceful and out solid instead of tossing a lot like I do, when I woke up I experienced no grogginess. With things like G-Fuel I noticed an over active amount of energy for awhile and alertness, but it would be sorta short lived and then the come down felt a little harsher. I would also start to feel icky after a bit either with a headache or an upset stomach because I might have consumed too much simply because I liked the taste or because I thought it would give me another boost. Taking straight B12 after awhile has no real effect for energy levels but at least I know I'm topped off there I guess. It's nice that this has a small mix of good vitamins with the B12. Weird to say, but it's nice to find something without taurine in it, can't hear the comment about drinking the inappropriate parts of a bull anymore lol. I'll still have to see what it does for my dad, but at least for me it was a good product, thanks to it I got my project done! :D Read more | 5.0\nI’m not much of a coffee drinker and have been cutting out my soda.  But, there are times when I need a boost of energy.  I find myself tired certain times of day, often when I’m at work or running errands. In my research, I came across Vitamin Energy shot. Price was reasonable.  So, I gave it a try.  I didn’t care for other energy products I’ve tried before, so I was skeptical. So far, so good.  The taste is ok.  It is better than most other similar products. More importantly, it seems to be working.  I feel more awake, without the headaches or nervousness.  One small container does the job.  I will continue to use as needed.  Would recommend. Read more | 5.0\nThey do tasty bad, but so does 5hour energy. Two doses per bottle? I don’t think so. They work and they’re cheaper than 5 hour. I chill mine and do them like a shot.  I don’t know how much caffeine is in them but they do work. I gotta say though I do like 5hour energy better.(except for the cost) Read more | 4.0\nI really wanted to like these energy shots, as they are half the price of the big name. They have a little more caffeine, but fewer other ingredients for energy boosting. I could get past that if not for 2 things (so, minus 2 stars): taste and impact on your digestive tract. For the latter concern, let's just say it gets me running, but for the wrong reasons :)  And as to the taste....I don't know how in the world some people say it tastes great (subjective, I guess?) To me, it's like taking sugar free Kool-Aid and mixing it with cough syrup, sans alcohol....no exaggeration. The big name stuff tastes gourmet by comparison. It gives a boost, so I drank mine but will likely use something else. Read more | 3.0\nI have been using Zipfizz Energy Shots for a couple of years and they have been a good source of energy and relief from migraine symptoms. When I discovered that I could no longer get that product (at least in it's original formula), I started looking for a replacement.  When I found Vitamin Energy Shots (VES) I decided to give it a try and have been pleased with the results.  Some reviewers have complained about the taste, but the taste hasn't bothered me at all.  The shots are only 1.97 oz compared with 4 oz Zipfizz, but I think they deliver as well as or even better.  I have been using VES two or three times per week and have found that it really works for me.  Vitamin Energy Shots claims that there are two \"doses\" per bottle.  I'm not sure how that works, but I have been using the whole 1.97 oz each time I have used the product.  I can't say that it delivers 7 hours of energy.  It last me about 5-6 hours and then tapers off. Ounce per ounce I think the price is about the same as Zipfizz.  I had been getting Zipfizz for $42 per 24 bottles and this product is $20 for 12 smaller bottles.  So far Vitamin Energy Shots seem to be a good replacement for Zipfizz.  I am ordering two boxes today. Update:  I have been using Vitamin Energy shot for several weeks now and have found it to be an excellent product, so I changed my rating to 5 stars.  I placed my third order today, but opted to buy the 48 count box because I save 62 cents per bottle that way.  The 12 packs costs 19.95 = 1.66 per bottle.  The 48 pack costs 49.95 = 1.06.  Something to consider. Read more | 5.0\nNot my favorite choice for energy drinks. Had a medicine taste that last for hours, and gave me heartburn Read more | 1.0\nI really enjoy this energy drink with 2 doses per bottle. Tastes great and is a good value for the cost. Read more | 5.0\nIf you find yourself getting drowsy while driving, here is a cheap and inexpensive way to wake you up. Within 5 to 15 minutes of taking half of the bottle, I am more alert, less likely to have an enough accident. One caveat: peel away the top layer so that you can easily open the bottle in the car while you’re driving. The plastic on the cap is not something that you can easily remove while you’re driving. I usually uncap two at a time and keep them near me. Read more | 5.0"

Read more | 5.0\nAfter drinking two redline extreme energy drinks per day for several years, I got worried that they had stopped working/waking me up, despite the ungodly amount of caffeine.  I switched to 5hr energy extra strength for a while but was disgusted at the nearly $4 price that they cost around here even though they worked nearly as well as the redline with less caffeine(I'm guessing other ingredients besides caffeine have an affect) I've tried half a dozen different cheap energy shots from Amazon and have always been disappointed until I found this one. This beats the Kirkland brand, stackers, etc hands down Read more | 5.0\nAfter having tried vitamin energy shots I cannot give it a good review. Usually I buy Kirkland brand but that didn’t have them so decided to try these.

    "reviews": "Watermelon Crush Variety Tropical Original Variety Orange Twist Mango Tango Citrus Burst Cherry Lime Paradise Punch I usually don’t like the typical energy drinks like Monster or Red Bull, but I LOVE this brand! My favorite thing about these energy drinks is that they are nutritionist-friendly. I even sent the nutritional facts to my nutritionist, and she said she’s going to start recommending this drink to other clients who are trying to make healthier choices. The Jaclyn Hill Orange Twist flavor is so refreshing, and the Electric Berry is another favorite of mine. With 150mg of caffeine, it gives me just the right amount of energy without any crash. Other claims: vegan, low calorie, and packed with natural ingredients like green tea caffeine and biotin—such a win! Highly recommend for anyone looking for a healthier energy drink alternative. Read more | 5.0\nThis is literally one of my favorite flavors of all time. The reason I found out about Gorgie is because of this Jaclyn Hill. So this flavor means the world to me. It’s not too sweet it’s the perfect amount of flavor. Before discovering Gorgie, I was cycling through energy drinks like Red Bull, C4, Alani, Monster, and even coffee. Almost all of them gave me anxiety, jitters, and that unpleasant tingling feeling all over my body. The crashes afterward were even worse. That all changed when I found Gorgie. These energy drinks are a total game-changer! They give me a natural, healthy boost of energy that lasts all day, without any anxiety or crashes. Honestly, I’ve never looked back. I’ve completely replaced coffee with Gorgie, and I couldn’t be happier. If you’re on the fence, don’t hesitate—just try it! 100,000/10. Highly recommended! Read more | 5.0\nI hate coffee, but I need caffeine in the morning; unfortunately, so many energy drinks are terrible for you. I am glad that Gorgie created a healthier alternative. One of the things I love about Gorgie is that they have a reasonable amount of biotin (100% DV). So many drinks or supplements that add biotin put in a ridiculous amount, like 10,000% your daily value, which for me and many others causes acne. Gorgie uses the perfect amount. I haven't really noticed a benefit from the l-theanine, but it is there. As for the flavors, I find the watermelon to be the best by far. I find the tropical punch to not have much flavor, and it is instead tastes more like a vaguely flavored sparkling drink, which isn't bad but also isn't good. The peach flavor is not good in my opinion, but not bad enough where I won't finish it. It has a very weird flavor sadly, which stinks because I love peach. I think it has something to do with its sweetener as it has a slight maple syrup aftertaste. Read more | 4.0\nI have been looking for a healthy energy drink and am thrilled to finally find Gorgie.  I love the taste and the ingredients! No energy crash.  I hope they continue the coupons that make it more affordable. Read more | 5.0\nThese are so refreshing and delicious! Perfect amount of caffeine for a pick me up. I wish they came in a smaller size though. I have a hard time finishing a full one. Read more | 5.0\nOh my gosh. I have found the best Energy Drink out there. You have to try these they are so good. Not overly sweet but sweet enough surprising for not having any sugar. They are so healthy for you. And yes you get the energy. These do so much more for me than coffee. Highly recommend worth every penny. Read more | 5.0\nI wouldn’t buy this variety pack again just because of how awful the peach flavor was. Didn’t taste like peach at all and left a horrible after taste. The other two flavors were pretty good. Read more | 3.0\nDecent taste. But let's face it we drink these for energy and can't expect it to taste amazing. It has the right amount of caffeine to give you just enough boost. A bit pricey which leads to a 1 star off. Read more | 4.0"

    "reviews": "Green Tea Agave Green Tea These were delicious and energy boosting.  Too expensive for me to use regularly, but I do love them.  I think this is a great product with quality ingredients and it even smells good. Read more | 5.0\nI was pleasantly surprised by how great these made me feel! These tiny little bottles pack a punch! I did notice a cumulative effect, and by day 5, I was really noticing a difference in my energy levels and mental clarity. They are handy to throw in your purse when heading out the door. I do like to drink these straight out of the fridge, but you don't have to keep them refrigerated. I recommend giving them a little shake before you drink because some of the natural ingredients can separate during storage. Overall, highly recommend as a clean energy option without the nasty and unhealthy ingredients, and no energy crash!! Read more | 5.0\nI ordered this product after reading the founder’s story. I related when he said his doctor told him he needed to drink less caffeine for the health of his heart. I had a similar experience working as a night shift ICU nurse during the pandemic. I was tired. Soooo tired. But the extra coffee I was drinking to make it through my long shifts gave me palpitations. I ended up with a heart monitor for a week to make sure my heart was ok. Fortunately, it is! However, my doctor recommended less caffeine.  Much less caffeine. I wish I could have found this product during that time period.  This little drink gave me a noticeable lift in energy with no crash. I avoided energy drinks like this forever because of the taste, but this one actually tastes good! I ordered the Matcha green tea flavor.  It was subtly sweet, as promised, and I actually enjoyed it. I love that the ingredients are all real, and actually improve my health.  You can’t say that about gas station energy drinks. It’s a small little dose, which made it quick to take, and the bottle fit easily into my lunch bag. I love that the benefits compound the longer I take this supplement. Give it a try! Read more | 5.0\nTypically I am a no-frills black coffee person and have been for years. I gave Magic Mind a shot as a supplement to my normal morning coffee routine and was pleasantly surprised. The shot is light and easy and goes best when chilled, shaken, and sipped alongside coffee or other caffeine of choice. An average day at my job requires a fair amount of writing and editing written work, so this supplement worked really effectively for a focused professional setting. I do believe it gave me an extra focus boost, particularly when taken on successive days to give it a chance to build. The ingredients are clean and unique to this supplement blend—the combo of matcha and adaptogens gave me the brain fuel I needed. I have a few suggestions to the brand. First, the price point might be a little high for customers that want to make this a routine habit. Perhaps as the brand grows the cost of production will decrease and the savings can be passed on to the consumer. Second, the flavor was a little heavy on the matcha, especially since it is “ceremonial grade” matcha. I might suggest the brand develops new flavor choices to give consumers a bigger variety and more subtle taste profiles. In the future, I envision an original, a tropical or fruity option, and maybe something akin to a vanilla. Overall, I would recommend this product to students or professionals who spend their time writing, reading, studying, and/or focusing on otherwise cognitively demanding tasks who need an extra boost for productivity and efficiency. Read more | 4.0\nThis product has been amazing for my afternoon slump. Great ingredients, that tase good and help you get through the rest of your day with no jitters. Top quality and delicious. Easy to open and just drink! Use for my son who has ADHD to help ger him through the evening after practice. Easy to drink and I don't have to worry about any nasty ingredients like your typical energy drinks. Read more | 5.0\nVery impressed. I have been taking these for a week and had the most productive week iv had in months. Sustained focus and energy all day, no crash, no brain fog. Read more | 5.0\nJust on my third so I can’t really ascertain if I feel more mentally alert or focused but the drink tastes pretty good and I think I feel a bit of an energy boost. Read more | 3.0\nFocus and productivity have been two big issues for me recently, so I was super excited to try this product! The first time i tried it, it definitely helped me with focus, and i enjoyed the energy boost without the crash or anxiety that i'd usually get from caffeine. It's become a regular part of my routine to drink one of these when I am working, and I overall love the product. The only issue for me, and suggestion i would make to the brand, is about the flavor. There is definitely a distinct taste to the product as well as an aftertaste that typically comes from things that use stevia as a sweetener. I would just suggest maybe adding some vanilla or trying out a different sweetener, because the aftertaste isn't great to me. But other than that, great product! Read more | 4.0"

    "reviews": "This is the basis of my kombucha syrup. I add about a cup and a half of sugar to this bottle to make the reduction. The less sugar I use, the more flavorful because of the combo of the deeply sweet pomegranate with the tart cranberry. Also grape juice is very sweet. On it's own, the juice is not light, and it's not meant to be. Pomegranate is a heavier and sweeter tasting fruit naturally. That's the beauty of adding other juices to cranberry juice.

But since I love black cherry, and the calorie amount was reasonable, I wanted to try this out. Overall, it is a small but mighty drink that packs in lots of flavor and gives you some extra pizzazz. Did I feel like I could suddenly work 6 more hours because I drank it? No...but I did feel extra pep and mental clarity to keep pushing through about 30 minutes later so that was really appreciated. The drink is quite tasty, extra refreshing if you enjoy it chilled, and I'd suggest putting it in smoothies, too for an extra healthy burst and flavor.

    "reviews": "I have used this product for a while but this was my first purchase via Amazon. 1 out of 12 cans was slightly dented, nothing significant. I read on reviews about exploding cans? As stated, I have used this product for sometime and never had an exploding can. Unlike other caffeinated energy drinks, this drink does not give me the jitters and really improves my focus and energy yet does not make me crash later. As far as taste, everyone taste things differently. I find too many other energy drinks over the top on sweetness. Bucked up is sweet, but not too strong. Suits my taste. . Read more | 5.0\nThese taste like they're old, or that they've been left in the sun.... You know how synthetic sugar does weird things when heated? Yea that. These don't taste fresh or good like when you buy them at the gas station. And because they were left in the heat somewhere, the flavor is mediocre too.... So don't recommend buying these from Amazon. Read more | 3.0\nI have been purchasing the Cherry Candy flavor for a while now and found the 12 pack on here to save some money per can. A few months ago my order came and it didn't taste right at all. The best way I can compare it to would be the grape flavor they have, so I thought maybe it was a mistake and they put it into the wrong cans. Well the entire box was this nasty flavor and I couldn't drink it. My husband ended up drinking them. I contacted the company to let them know and a lady I spoke to said they changed the formula for it to make it less sweet. Well, they severely messed it up. I don't understand how you could released a product named Cherry Candy when it doesn't taste remotely like cherry. I thought I'd give it one more shot and the next case was even worse. I don't know how it was different again but it was. There was a strange aftertaste and wasn't drinkable. I contacted the email address the lady from the company gave me to request a refund and no one got back to me. It's just really unprofessional to conduct business this way and I won't be purchasing from them ever again. This was a very disappointing experience for me. It's hard for me to find flavors that aren't gross and this one had become my favorite. If the company sees this PLEASE CHANGE IT BACK TO THE ORIGINAL FORMULA!!!

Limited Availability: Depending on location, the Bucked Up Energy Drink may not be readily accessible in all markets, making it challenging for some consumers to purchase.

It is difficult to find energy drinks without the carbonation. They have an average amount of caffeine content compared to other drinks.

    "reviews": "Wild Orchard White Gummy Deer Sour Bucks Pink Lemonade Breezy Blast Blue Raz Blood Raz I wish these were sold at gas stations near me! Back when I was in Germany with the US Army, I always grabbed them at the shoppette. After trying them, I never went back to Monster or Red Bull. They taste amazing and deliver exactly what you need. These got me through countless 24-hour CQ shifts and long workdays, so I know they’re perfect for anyone with a demanding, hard-working job who needs a reliable pick-me-up. Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nSuch a great flavor! Read more | 5.0\nThis Bucked Up Energy Drink doesn’t just wake you up—it launches you into another dimension where productivity is limitless, and bad decisions seem like great ideas. 300mg of caffeine? Oh yeah, that’s the secret sauce that turns \"just five more minutes\" into \"I deep-cleaned the entire house, reorganized my emails, and might run a marathon.\" Flavor? Solid. Jitters? Surprisingly minimal (unless you chug it, which, let’s be honest, I did). If you need a boost that doesn’t mess around, this is the one. Just don’t drink it at night unless you enjoy staring at the ceiling, contemplating life choices at 2 AM. Read more | 5.0\nIt saddens me to have to leave this type of review because it has absolutely NOTHING to do with the product itself. As someone who works out a lot and can take a significant amount of caffeine at once, I absolutely adore Bucked Up energy drinks. I purchased one in the local store just to try it because I was just making the move from 250mg to 300mg, so I wanted to go very slowly until I was sure my body would handle it well. Surprisingly, I enjoyed the drinks and have been hooked ever since. HOWEVER, Amazon should be ashamed of themselves how poorly this was packaged and shipped. My cans were loose and all over the place. The box was coming apart. They weren't in their case, they were thrown all over the box. I know one burst and most of the product was gone. I didn't even get to drink that one, so I just popped the top and poured the remaining out. Several of the cans were all dented up. What is this? I spent $30 on 12 cans of energy drinks, then I expect 12 cans of energy drinks. I can't send this back. At least not all of it since I had to throw one away, but I suspect they know this, so they don't care. I have definitely been cheated with these. I don't know who needs to fix this in their shipping/handling department, but something has got to give. I am a loyal buyer when I find something I like. Please don't make me look for this product elsewhere. This was not a good look at all. I am so disappointed, which is unfortunate because I actually like the product. All I can do is shake my head. Get it together!!!! Read more | 1.0\nGood taste and caffeine content only downside is it spills over when you open it. Could be overfilled or too much carbonation. It’ll wake you up though. Read more | 4.0\nFirst off, I haven't had a bad tasting Bucked Up.  Haven't had them all, but the ones I have had (Miami, Rocket Pop, Blue Raz and White Gummy) are all really good.  Hard to pick a favorite, tastes change week to week. My only issue is a personal one, caffeine does nothing for me!  I drink one of these almost every morning and I'm still doing the head bobble thing at my desk.  Might be in part to the mind numbing job I have, but that's another review!  Cheers Read more | 5.0\nGreat product and perfect shipping time Read more | 5.0\nThe flavor isn't so bad although several cans of mine fizzed up by themselves even though they weren't shaken so definitely be ready to sip unless you're okay with a mess. It has a softer cherry flavor but it's slightly there & it's alright it just gets annoying how many cans fizz up. Might consider getting more but if the fizz problem occurs again I'll most likely stop. Read more | 3.0"

The quality of cans are perfect as he's shuffling them back and forth between his work bags and totes.  We buy these on a subscription because he never wants to run out! Read more | 5.0\nI've been reordering these energy drinks consistently. These are my favorite flavor, and they aren't too carbonated like some other brands, which make you burp ridiculously. This flavor (Black Cherry) isn't overly sweet like some other brands. This one keeps me awake and alert without the crash later. I also love that they’re zero sugar, so I get the energy boost without the extra calories or sugar crash. Whether I need an extra push in the morning or a pick-me-up during long study sessions, this drink always delivers. Definitely a must-have for anyone who needs sustained energy and focus! Read more | 5.0\nThese were cheaper than Monster and figured I’d give them a try. They certainly work, and maybe even better than Monster, as it takes me 2 Monsters to feel anything, but one can of C4 had me covered for a whole 8 hour shift and 2 hrs on the road. The taste is not so bad. If you’re already used to sugar free energy drinks, you already know it’ll have a sort of off after taste you need to get used to. This Satrburst flavor is true to the candy, but the aftertaste is a little medicinal. But after a couple sips, you look past it. But the only peculiar thing about this drink is the itchy, pins and needles sensation it riddles your body with. Just sitting idly, I feel it. And when startled (ex: by a car suddenly hitting the breaks), the pins are felt in overdrive. It’s really unpleasant, as it feels like I’m wearing itchy clothes, and I begin sweating. Hopefully I can get used to it. But all in all I’m sticking to Monster. tl;dr: pros: taste, energy|cons: itchy sensation Read more | 4.0\nIf you're on the hunt for an energy drink that truly delivers on its promises, look no further than C4 Energy. As someone who has tried countless energy drinks, I can confidently say that C4 stands head and shoulders above the rest. It's the one energy drink that consistently gives me the boost I need and can actually feel! First and foremost, the effectiveness of C4 Energy is unmatched. Whether I'm gearing up for an intense workout, facing a long day at work, or needing an afternoon pick-me-up, a can of C4 never fails to energize me. The blend of 200mg caffeine, 1.6 beta-alanine, and other performance-enhancing ingredients works wonders, providing a clean and sustained energy boost without the dreaded crash. Taste is another area where C4 excels. With a variety of delicious flavors, there's something for everyone. Whether you prefer fruity, refreshing, or more traditional energy drink flavors, C4 has you covered. Each sip is a burst of flavor that makes reaching for a can a treat in itself. What sets C4 apart is the noticeable difference in how it makes me feel compared to other energy drinks. C4 provides a smooth and focused energy that enhances my performance and concentration while delivering a full body sensory experience. It's the perfect companion for both physical and mental tasks. Additionally, C4 Energy often contains zero sugar and low calories, making it a great choice for those who are health-conscious. You can enjoy the benefits of an energy drink without the guilt of consuming excessive sugar or calories. In summary, C4 Energy is truly the best energy drink on the market. Its effectiveness, great taste, and noticeable impact set it apart from the competition. If you're looking for an energy drink that you can actually feel and enjoy, I highly recommend giving C4 a try. It has become my go-to energy drink, and I can't imagine tackling my day without it! Read more | 5.0\nI love the Cellucor C4 Performance Energy Drink in Jolly Rancher Watermelon flavor! It’s a great pre-workout boost with 200mg caffeine and zero sugar.

    "reviews": "Blueberry White Tea Tropical Tea Sweet Tea Raspberry Tea Mango Half & Half Lemon Tea Green Tea Diet Green Tea Diet Arnold Palmer Arnold Palmer Rx Energy If you’re looking for a refreshing beverage that’s light on calories but still packs a punch in flavor, AriZona Diet Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey is a solid choice. Packed in a convenient 22oz can, this tea offers the perfect balance of sweet, earthy green tea and the natural sweetness of honey. Plus, with the addition of ginseng, you get that extra bit of energy to keep you going without the sugar overload. If you’re a fan of iced tea but want to cut down on calories, this one’s for you! Pros: 1. Great Taste: The combination of green tea, honey, and ginseng creates a flavorful, smooth taste that’s not too sweet, making it enjoyable for a wide range of palates. 2. Low-Calorie: With only a few calories per serving, this drink is perfect for those who want to indulge in a refreshing beverage without feeling guilty. 3. Convenient Packaging: The 22oz can is large enough to quench your thirst but still portable. It’s the perfect size to throw in your bag for a quick refreshment during the day. 4. Natural Sweetness: The honey provides a natural sweetness without the artificial aftertaste that some sugar substitutes can leave behind. It’s a nice touch for those who prefer more natural ingredients. 5. Energy Boost: The inclusion of ginseng gives you a light energy boost without the jitters or crash you might get from traditional energy drinks or sodas. Cons: 1. Not for Those Who Prefer Strong Green Tea Flavor: While it’s a smooth, balanced flavor, some might find the green tea taste a bit mild and overshadowed by the honey and ginseng. If you’re a fan of a strong, bold green tea flavor, this might not hit the spot. 2. Could Use More Ginseng: Although ginseng is included, the effects might be subtle for those looking for a more noticeable energy boost. You may not feel much of a difference if you’re used to more potent energy supplements. 3. Artificial Sweeteners: Even though the product claims natural ingredients, some may notice a slight artificial taste due to the inclusion of artificial sweeteners in the mix. 4. Caffeine Sensitivity: The tea contains caffeine, so if you’re sensitive to it, you may want to watch how much you drink, especially late in the day to avoid disrupting your sleep. All in all, AriZona Diet Green Tea with Ginseng and Honey is a refreshing, low-calorie option that’s both tasty and energizing. It’s perfect for anyone looking to cut back on sugary sodas while still enjoying a flavorful beverage. Just be mindful of the sweetness and caffeine if you’re sensitive to those factors.

    "reviews": "ZERO Variety Pack Variety Pack Punch Variety Pack ZERO Wild Ruby Red ZERO Wild Ice Pop ZERO Wild Berry Yerba Mate Tropical Punch Peach Mango Original Lite Fruit Punch ZERO Wild Strawberry Watermelon Love these flavors! Caffeine content just right for me. I only drink half a can a day and it supplies enough energy to get me going on days I don’t have time to make coffee Read more | 5.0\nTastes good, quality ingredients and kept me awake to finish term papers overnight. Read more | 5.0\nIf you're anything like me, you have a busy life, and getting 8+ hours of sleep every night just doesn't happen. You need something to get through your day, and the proliferation of mass-market energy drinks has led you to chugging one, two, three or even more in a day! Not good! I know my own Bed Rull (clever!) drinking was getting out-of-control, and it was having a serious impact on both my health and my wallet. In my desperation for a source of healthier, more cost and eco friendly energy, I turned to my local natural grocery store and found this: GURU Lite. Made with Stevia instead of all those \"let's all wait for the news story about the horrible health impacts\" artificial sweeteners, and containing only ingredients you can actually pronounce (sparking water, lemon juice, cane juice, guarana seed, luo han gua juice, steevia, echinacea, ginko, ginseng)it sounded pretty promising. But what about the energy? Well it works, I took my first sip, went \"oh well, crap, doesn't work\" and then 2 minutes later I was awake! No jitters, no \"surge-o-epic caffeine\" - just awake. It's refreshing, if you're used to the \"wired wired wired wired zing zoom bzzzzz crash!\" of normal energy drinks, get ready for one that actually just makes you feel like yourself. Not wired, not tired, not cranky, not crazy, just a couple extra hours of focus as YOU! But what about the flavor? GURU Lite is best described as \"not bad\", I like it room temperature, you may prefer it chilled. Unlike those commercial heart-attacks-in-a-can, GURU focused on health over sugar-load, so expect a slightly lemony, earthy herbal taste. It is not by an means bad tasting, but it's not like liquid candy, it's a simple, natural flavor that doesn't overwhelm or make you want to chug twenty of them. You drink this for the health and energy, and the taste is secondary. I don't want you to think \"oh it tastes bad...\" because it doesn't, it's just the taste is definitely not the focus, it's not a soda, it's more like a glass of water - you drink it because you're thirsty, and this, you drink because you are tired and want to be awake. What about the cost? Well, Amazon has the best deal around. I chose the subscribe-and-save option and came home to find a box, wrapped in a clear plastic wrap to protect against rain, two days later. Inside was my case of GURU (which looks exactly like the picture). I found with GURU not only am I drinking fewer of them than I did with Bed Rull, but I'm able to sleep better and of course I'm ending each month with tons of cash in my pocket that is no longer being spent on over-priced, junk-laden commercial \"energy\". And the best part? I have all the energy I want at hand in a far, far healthier package. Give it a shot today, you will be pleasantly surprised. Read more | 4.0\nI don’t typically like sparkling drinks. They are hard to drink. They tend to make me feel bloated, and usually they taste terrible because they’re meant to be on the lighter side, calorie wise. For example, Celsius sparkling drinks. I LOVE the non carbonates drinks they make! But the sparkling/carbonation side of them make them hard to enjoy, and the taste is not as good as their non carbonated drinks. If you’ve tried them, you know what I mean. These drinks are also sparkling, but somehow they aren’t as “carbonated” feeling and tasting! Impressive! They have a perfect balance for that effect. Makes it easier to chug when I’m in a hurry. Was also worried about the taste! I’ve never tasted Yerba mate, so I was expecting a very strong earthy taste. It mostly taste like a delicate mint taste with a mild “artificial” sweetening aftertaste and a hint of tea. Seriously impressed. Usually when you see all these healthier ingredients you know it’s good for you, or better for you anyways, but you know it’s probably not going to taste very good. One example of a “lighter” drink such as this one, or similar anyways as far as the use of “better ingredients” in the product, is the jocko willink energy drink. In the ingredients list, you will see things that will make you feel better about drinking the product. But it doesn’t taste good at all. This drink has great ingredients and balanced use of them to give it just enough taste and carbonation, to enjoy. I’m amazed with this product and will buy two more of these cases. I regret not getting the variety packs at sams when they did carry them, because I want to try the other flavors. Give these a shot if you so t mins a light tasting, light carbonation effect energy drink Read more | 5.0\nI wasted $50.00 on an unsuspecting change in recipe that showed up at my door.  The GURU original use to be AMAZING, now it takes like overly sweet artificial crap.  There was no warning on this change, so BEWARE.  If you like the beverage in the can without the \"Good Energy Original\" writing at the bottom of the can, this is no longer in existence.  Amazon will not give you a refund for this change either unless the product is damaged... Read more | 1.0\n10/10 flavor and ingredients. These are my go-to energy drink! Read more | 5.0\nI've tried them all and this is my favorite energy drink by far. Very clean organic ingredients, including the caffeine sources. No jitters, just gooood energy!

One sip, and suddenly, I’m organizing my entire garage, signing up for a 5K, and considering learning Mandarin. Now, let’s talk about the real magic here: the energy boost. Halfway through my second can, I could see sounds and hear colors. By the third, I was typing at 300 words per minute, and by the fourth… well, I think I briefly phased into another dimension.

This stuff made me give up Monster permanently. Read more | 5.0\nI am a trucker who likes to have a little caffeine sipping drink in one cup holder and my water in the other, and sugar free Red Bull is the perfect size and caffeine amount! I can sip on it for a few hours without getting the jitters, yet it is still small enough that I can finish it before it goes flat. I do not feel like I get an energy crash when the caffeine wears off, which is extremely important for someone who drives a 40-ton vehicle. It just helps wake me up faster in the morning because I don’t have a coffee maker in my rig and don’t always want to have to walk all the way into the truck stop for a coffee, so I keep some in my truck fridge. I am also a student and have cracked open a Red Bull at the end of my work day to get some school work done, and it gives me the energy pick me up that I need, but I can still fall asleep after, so I’m not too wired from it! Out of dozens and dozens of orders, have received a few packs that were dented up, and only once did I receive an order so badly banged up that a few leaked, but it seemed to be more of a delivery issue from the weight of them, but Amazon made it right!!! I also had a malfunction in my truck fridge and the entire fridge froze, and only one of the Red Bull cans leaked, but the others were just expanded and I really appreciated only having to clean up one Red Bull slushy, so keep making those cans as sturdy as you have been!!! Read more | 5.0\nAfter 3 months the new RB Zero, now with monk fruit is in stock. I loved the previous version but this one is a close second and very enjoyable. I’m just happy Amazon got it in stock and I can continue my subscribe and save and get my orders on a regular basis. Read more | 5.0\nRed Bull Total Zero is an excellent choice for those who want the energy boost of a traditional Red Bull without the sugar and calories. The flavor is quite similar to the original Red Bull, with a slightly less sweet taste, which I find refreshing. It provides the same energy-boosting effects, thanks to its blend of caffeine, taurine, and B vitamins, making it perfect for a quick pick-me-up or pre-workout drink. I appreciate that it offers the same performance enhancement without the added sugar, making it a guilt-free option.

The flavor is like a fruity, sparkling party in a can—perfectly sweet with no sugar and no weird aftertaste. It’s hard to describe the flavor exactly, but it feels like a mix of berry and grape with a fun, cosmic twist. What’s even better is that it gives me the energy I need without the crash. I drink it in the afternoon for a pick-me-up, and it keeps me going through work or a workout. The fact that it’s sugar-free makes it guilt-free too! The packaging is super cute and eye-catching, and the carbonation level is just right—not too fizzy, not flat. I’d recommend this to anyone looking for a delicious and refreshing energy drink. This one is my absolute favorite flavor from Alani Nu, and I can’t wait to keep stocking up! Read more | 5.0\nI recently started using Alani Nutrition products, and I am so impressed! The Alani Energy Drinks are my new go-to for a quick pick-me-up. They taste amazing (I’m obsessed with the Watermelon flavor!), and they give me a clean, sustained energy boost without any jitters or crashes. I’ve also tried the Alani Pre-Workout, and it delivers on all fronts—great taste, increased energy, and enhanced focus during my workouts. I love how it’s packed with ingredients that actually make a difference in my performance, plus it doesn’t upset my stomach like some other pre-workouts do. What I really appreciate is how Alani uses high-quality, transparent ingredients with no artificial junk. Plus, their products are all about supporting a healthy lifestyle, which resonates with me. If you're looking for a delicious, effective, and clean energy boost or supplement, I highly recommend giving Alani Nutrition a try. I can’t wait to try more products from them!

    "reviews": "Had a hard time securing the large amounts of Bang we wanted for a daily habit. Little leery of ordering any food products online, but they seem good. Honestly the only sugar free energy drink we can tolerate, much better cold, but I REALLY need a large dose of caffeine and I need to drop the sugar. We like a variety of flavors, but find some of them they can make our stomachs hurt if we drink them daily, our go to is peach mango (which is NOT what I would have guessed for me, lol), but we like the strawberry, blue raspberry, cotton candy, birthday cake the best, and the purple haze isn't bad, the sour flavors....forget it, lol, my old stomach can't. Bang honestly is the best energy drink I have tried. It doesn't usually give me the jitters, it doesn't usually make me crash (unless I drink the whole thing really fast for some reason or I am having a particularly bad day), it tastes MILES better than anything else sugar free....all the orders have arrived in tact, and I don't have to worry about having to track down an energy drink from every grocery store/gas station like some sort of crazy person...I ain't got the time...I just need large quantities of caffeine to function because of health problems, lol. Read more | 5.0\nMy favorite flavor of bang and I always grab a case when it goes on sale! These are no joke though and have 300mg of caffeine!

Read more | 5.0\nIn my opinion of the variety of flavors offered by bang, this is the best one. Tastes like a purple skittle. It boosts my energy level and focus with out the jitters.

It’s a pretty good flavor, for it being one of the few Flavors that doesn’t have artificial coloring which is a big plus as well. Make sure to shake well always before each sip so you can get the full experience and mixture because it will all start to fall to the bottom over a few minutes. Definitely recommend if you want that extra little boost of energy and focus in your day or to wake you up in the mornings. Recommend not to drink it too late at night so you’re not wired before bed, but everyone is different! Quality is definitely there! The taste strength is a little less than other flavors but after a few times you will start to enjoy it.

I mean, who would have thought that a video game-inspired energy drink would actually taste good? But let me tell you, this stuff is legit. First of all, let's talk about the packaging. As a huge fan of the Fallout franchise, I was already sold on the Nuka Cola Quantum theme. The bright blue color and retro design really stand out on my kitchen counter, and it's always a conversation starter when friends come over. But let's get down to the important stuff – the taste. I love the sugar-free energy powder, and i was pleasantly surprised. The Nuka Cola Quantum flavor is like a mix of fruity goodness with a hint of citrus, and it's not too sweet or artificial tasting. It's like a party in your mouth every time you take a sip. And the energy boost? Oh boy, let me tell you – this stuff works. I usually mix up a drink in the morning before work, and I don't even need my usual cup of coffee anymore. The energy lasts for hours without any jitters or crash, which is a huge plus in my book. But here's the best part – the Nuka Cola Quantum Energy Powder is actually good for you. With vitamins, antioxidants, and no artificial colors or flavors, I feel good about fueling my day with this stuff. Plus, it's so much cheaper and more convenient than grabbing a sugary energy drink from the store. Overall, I have to give the G Fuel Nuka Cola Quantum Energy Powder a solid 5 stars. It's tasty, effective, and just plain fun to drink. So if you're a gamer, an energy drink enthusiast, or just looking for a little pick-me-up during the day, give this stuff a try. You won't be disappointed. Read more | 5.0\nI got this particular flavor because it was discounted. I actually assumed at first that it was gonna be cola flavored. Surprisingly, it has a tropical, fruity flavor. I don't really know what to compare it to and I don't have a super sophisticated pallet, but I think I tasted coconut and maybe some pineapple. Basically it's like a fruit punch with some combination of your typical tropical fruits. While not one of my absolute favorite Gfuel flavors, it definitely falls in the enjoyable category. Read more | 5.0\nThis is a weird one, you will either love or hate it. I love coconut, but when I tasted this, a medicinal flavor seemed prominent. Then I realized that the medicine flavor was actually a slight cola, not mixing well with the tropical stuff. Now that my brain can process the flavors, I love this… but it takes some getting used to. It’s also a very strong flavor, so if you prefer lighter flavors, don’t bother with Nuka Cola Quantum.

    "reviews": "Tasty, cost-effective, cleanish energy & vitamins. I sometimes mix with unflavored collagen peptides and it blends well. Hubs likes to use partial packets in 16oz water to make them last longer. I like that it's not so much caffeine that I crash. The flavors are decent, a little vitaminy, but I expected that. We are repeat buyers and will continue unless they change the price or use lower quality ingredients. I also like that it doesn't have sucralose and isn't in a chunky plastic container like another brand. Read more | 5.0\nI love the pureboost hydration and energy packets. I love the flavors so much and it’s a plus that it is all natural. It gives me sustained energy without a crash while also hydrating with me. I really like to have these before and during the gym! Read more | 5.0\nHighly recommend for a gym pre-workout for anyone looking for no jitters, no itch, just energy. Also good throughout the day as a pick me up! I love the taste, it's tart and and doesn't taste like artificial sweeteners which are an automatic no for my taste buds. It's clean energy, no jitters, no buzzing, no crash and I use it to boost me up for the gym, especially on 4:30 am days. I'm giving 4 stars instead of 5 just because when used on an empty stomach it can cause some upset for some people (just like any B vitamin complex, green tea can also have the same effect!) I like to go to the gym on an empty stomach and learned if I only used half a packet it didn't affect me at all and I still got a great boost, so there's definitely a work around and the product works so well it's worth it! (Plus only using 1/2 or 3/4 of a packet at a time saved me some money in the long run, so win-win) Now that I started intermittent fasting, this will break your fast because it has 25 calories and also 2 grams of carbs so if you're doing keto or fasting it's something to be aware of to fit it into your day properly. All in all fantastic product that I've been using for years Read more | 4.0\nI love that this product uses methylcobalamin for the B12 that’s the whole reason I bought it. I wish the other products offered by this company did as well. The taste is very reminiscent of a sweettart it was a bit string at the first sip but not something I couldn’t adjust to. The fizz does need to be watched out for (as the box says) I accidentally created a gushing geyser in my thermos more than once All in all a very good product Have already purchased in a larger quantity for daily use Read more | 5.0\nI love the taste and ease of drinking the Pureboost mixes. It has made my water intake increase by at least double. I bought the combo pack to see what flavor I liked best, but I love them all!  It helps me to want to drink more water. Having no sugar and no crash is good for me to be able to drink these all day long. Read more | 5.0\nI recently cut out sucralose and I have had a hard time finding a solid energy drink replacement. These come in convenient packets, have a healthy amount of clean caffeine at 100mg (so I can have more than one a day if I wish), and it has a bunch of other ingredients for health benefits! I have replaced morning coffee with this and I actually gave some to my wife as she was recently sick and she said it helped her feel much better. She’s also very picky with flavor but enjoyed açaí flavor! 100% would recommend this to any of my friends looking to replace sucralose ridden energy drinks with a clean alternative. Read more | 5.0\nLove the drink and have been drinking it for while now but it has too high of a percentage of b vitamins. My bloodwork was crazy off from drinking it daily. I had to stop drinking it to make sure it was the cause and it was.  I also only like the citrus flavor. The others taste like chalky medicine. But I love the clean energy the drink provides. Read more | 4.0\nI can't use any fake sugar, hate coffee and resorted to soda in the morning for my \"boost\". I tried Pure Boost and I was so impressed with the flavor and how I felt after drinking it! I had energy and felt...alive, not sure how else to explain it. I LOVE the Acai Berry most but all flavors are excellent and that little fizz helps with my carbonation fix. ;)  I am forever a customer! Thank you for this! Read more | 5.0"

Here’s why: What I Love: 🌟 Unique Flavor: The strawberry and apricot blend is delicious and refreshing! It’s fruity and sweet but not overly sugary – a perfect balance. I find it way more enjoyable than regular Red Bull flavors. 🌟 Energizing Kick: With 80mg of caffeine, I get a nice, steady boost without feeling jittery or over-caffeinated. It’s the perfect pick-me-up for those long workdays or before a workout. 🌟 Taurine & B Vitamins: The added taurine and B vitamins provide an extra energy boost and help keep me focused. I feel more alert and productive after having one of these! 🌟 Convenient Pack: The pack of 24 cans is great for stocking up, and I love having them on hand for when I need a quick energy boost. The cans are perfectly sized at 8.4 fl oz, making them easy to carry around in my bag or keep in my fridge. 🌟 No Crash: I’ve noticed that after drinking the Red Bull Amber Edition, I don’t experience the usual energy crash that some energy drinks give me. The boost feels more balanced, and I stay energized for hours. Why It’s Worth It: The Red Bull Amber Edition has quickly become my go-to energy drink because it combines great taste with reliable energy. I love the strawberry apricot flavor, and it gives me just the right amount of energy to power through my day without any crashes. ⭐ Rating: 5/5 If you're looking for a tasty and effective energy drink that’s both flavorful and energizing, the Red Bull Amber Edition Strawberry Apricot is a must-try.

Read more | 5.0\nI have been ordering Monster off Amazon for a couple of years now. Amazon is by far the best price and the only place I can purchase a 15 pack of Monster. I have gotten Monster for under 2.00 a can by purchasing the sugar free flavors that are under $30. All of the flavors are decent, I’d have to say I lean more towards the berry flavors with Strawberry dreams being my favorite. But all Monster’s  have a crisp refreshing taste to them. The biggest and only problem I run into with purchasing Monster through Amazon is, the package have been damaged in the past. Very few cans have been dented. I have only had 3 cans ever be delivered that were not full and that was not Amazons fault it was a manufacturing error. These can’s were not dented, no holes were in these can’s, the top’s had not be opened at all. They were simply not filled correctly through the Monster warehouse. I never contacted Amazon about the 3 particular damaged cans or any of the damaged boxes. I did try to reach out to Monster and it was far too complicated to do so. They only allow you to contact them via their page that has particular options on how, what and where you purchased your Monster product.  purchasing a 15 pack of Monster through Amazon are not options. I also struggled with seeing  some of the information Monster requires off the can that is damaged. All in all I would recommend to anyone who drinks Monster on a regular basis for their daily boost of energy to purchase through Amazon. Read more | 5.0\nI purchased the Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango Sugar Free for my son, who needs a boost of energy but can't have the sugar. This drink is exactly what we were looking for! The flavor is delicious and refreshing, with a nice tropical mango taste that isn't too overpowering. It's sweetened just enough to make it enjoyable, but without any of the sugar that would normally be a concern. The energy boost is noticeable, and it helps my son stay focused and alert without any jitters or crashes, which can sometimes happen with other energy drinks. Plus, it's a great option for anyone looking to avoid sugar but still need that pick-me-up. Overall, I highly recommend Monster Energy Ultra Fiesta Mango for anyone who needs an energy boost but wants to keep things sugar-free. It’s a win-win! Read more | 5.0\nI have tried EVERY flavor of Monster Zero Ultra and overall, love this product, love the taste, and love that it's sugar-free and only 10 calories THAT BEING SAID, not every flavor is created equal. The BEST flavors of Monster Ultra are... -Paradise (green can, tastes like green Jolly Ranchers) -Sunrise (orange, tastes like Sunny D but carboated) -Watermelon -Peachy Keen (this one is so friggin good, it's crazy how good it is) The WORST flavors are... -Fiesta Mango! Stay away from this one! It tastes so bad, it tastes like how a hair salon smells when someone gets their hair permed! -Red (It's just not very good, just has a very vague flavor). -Black (Also just not very good, tastes like cough medicine) But for real though, do NOT get the Fiesta Mango. It...is...so...bad! Read more | 5.0\n5.0\n5.0\nIl gusto migliore preferito,ottimo | 5.0\nVon Monster Energy eins meiner liebsten Sorten, sehr angenehmer Wassermelonengeschmack! | 5.0\n1.0"

    "reviews": "Wild Berry Raspberry Mystic Melon Mixed-12 Grape Blue Raspberry Mixed Display This is a great way to get your day started or keep it going. It has a great taste and is very easy to take and take with you on the go. The packets are sealed well so no spilling in your purse. It does not have the crash effect of some of the other drinks I have tried.  No jitters, no headache just plenty of focus to get you moving or keep you moving. I put mine in the fridge just so they are not room temp. Love this product, am a fan and will keep buying. Read more | 5.0\nThese Extra Strength Energy Shots in Blue Raspberry flavor deliver a strong, fast, and reliable energy boost. I mainly use them when I don’t have time for coffee or to power through 12-hour delivery shifts during the Christmas season. They work great, and I take them straight up instead of mixing them into anything. Pros: ✅ Quick & Effective Energy—Kicks in fast and lasts. ✅ Convenient & Portable—Perfect for busy days. ✅ Sugar-Free—No crash. ✅ I Actually Like the Flavor!—But it’s not for everyone. Cons: ❌ Not a True 2oz Shot—Packets range between 1.5–1.8oz since the packaging itself weighs 0.2oz, and brings into question the accuracy of the nutrition facts. ❌ Looks Like Pee When Mixed in Water—If you try to dilute it, be warned! It’s not the most appetizing color. Caution (Not a Con!): ⚠️ Respect the Two-A-Day Limit! I had a second one six hours after the first, and I definitely understand why they warn against exceeding two. Final Thoughts: If you need a strong energy boost, these work great. Just don’t expect a full 2oz, and if you mix it with water, brace yourself for an unfortunate color. 😂⚡🔥 Read more | 4.0\nI bought them for the caffeine vs buying energy drinks. They are much better priced and I dont have to drink all that extra stuff with them. Mystic melon is pretty good, but the other one that has a red label has a funky taste to it. Read more | 5.0\nLooking for Gu replacement, this was a fluid with bad taste, recommend just sticking with brand name Gu or Cliff Blocks (better nutrients and lower caffeine content) Read more | 1.0\nI've tried all kinds of caffeine/energy drinks, and this is actually the only one that has any effect on me. I like the fact that it's flat and portable. I just tear each side toward the middle and it opens easily. I drink half at a time, because however they ration out and combine the ingredients actually has an impact on me. It's a nice change, and somehow I've been sleeping deeper at night. Not sure if that has anything to do with anything, or just that I'm off of work for these two days 😂 But I love these and will definitely be ordering more. Flavors are not bad, I've tried grape and the melon ones so far. Read more | 5.0\nFirst one I tried was the melon. It was just liquid with an unnatural melon taste. I am planning on putting the gels in my water/isotonic drink. I did keep my energy levels up so they do seem to do the job. Read more | 3.0\nThere is 250mg of caffein and taurine in this. I bought this product for a few reasons. 1. I am on a keto diet, and this does not send me out of ketosis but does provide energy. 2. I am used to using pre- work out from power lifting, but currently I am training for my first sprint triathlon. This product does not give you a sugar rush, note that I have adjusted my daily caffein intake to take this supplement while training. (this is closer to a mild pre-workout, with a shorter bust of energy and less whip lash) Effect- 6.5/10 for energy boost (on keto) Muscle aches in mid exercise went away, and I felt energized within 10 minutes of drinking this and the effects lasted 40 minutes. I was expecting this to last closer to 60 or 90 minutes and potentially making me have diarrhea because of the 250mg of caffein but that was not the case. 2 hours later and no indigestion or diarrhea. The come down is not steep or depleting, instead its linear and easy. all in all 8/10, I would just like the boost to last a little longer and I personally did not feel the taurine or get any tingling in my face. Taste? yah its okay, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting after reading the other reviews. Its a pre-work out in a tube, and I have tasted a lot worse pre work outs. But its definitely not a sweet get/ syrup. Read more | 5.0\nThe media could not be loaded. Update II: There doesn't seem to be any consistency, yet the price increased by almost 50%. They are supposed to be 2oz shots. They range from 1.8 to 2oz shots with the packaging. The packaging is .2oz, so you're really getting 1.6 to 1.8oz.  Ill just go back to 5hr Energy. I know what Im getting, and it's consistent. UPDATE: Its been about a week. The best thing to compare these to are Dollar Store XTreme Energy Shots, but with better flavor. They're ok, but they're no 5-Hour Energy.  For the current price, I'll keep using them. No jitters, and no crash. Up to 4 stars. I'm going to start this at 2 stars, because literally nobody paid for it - everyone received it for free. I paid for it. It gets 1 star because it showed up, and it's budget friendly. It gets a second star, because so far, the Melon one tastes pretty good. It doesn't have that sour afterbite of a 5 hour Energy. I WILL update this post within a few days, after I've had a chance to use the product. Read more | 2.0"

    "reviews": "Good if you need caffeine with no carbonation. Read more | 5.0\nFirst pack I got one a couple exploded. But second package came back fine. These are $1.75 per can. Much cheaper than my local gas station that sell these. Plus I don’t have to try and hunt this flavor down. These taste great! Favorite flavor. Not too sweet! Just the right amount of caffeine :) Read more | 5.0\nI like this product -- my only frustration is the trouble I have finding it in stores -- even the major military commissary! So I'm having it delivered to ensure that I can drink it every day in place of orange juice. I used to drink the Mtn. Dew Energy Drink, where every flavor had 100% of Vitamin C. I am only buying the flavors with a large percentage of Vitamin C, and right now, it looks like that's only the strawberry lemonade. Read more | 5.0\nStarted receiving this product on auto ship. My initial purchases had water, coconut water, bovine collagen peptides as the first three ingredients. I was happy with the price because of that formulation. The last shipment I just received has water, lemon juice concentrate, magnesium (25% daily value; which I imagine as a quarter of a pill's worth) as first three ingredients. I do not value this formulation the same as the original. But the seller does state packaging varies...... Will be cancelling my auto ship Read more | 3.0\nHas a bit more taste than many energy drinks.  But still taste should be stronger. Read more | 4.0\nI’ve been a Rockstar consumer for a long while and the new recovery flavor is by far the best they’ve done. To my palate it’s like a lighter version of their fruit punch (which was great to mix with the lemonade). Definitely give it a look if you’re a recovery drinker and I’d say even more so if you’re drinking the Regab version of this. Rockst⭐️r is way better 😎👍🏼 Read more | 5.0\nDelicious drink, but buy it from anywhere else. I've ordered this three times, and two of the three times the drinks came in boxes with holes in it, with 1-3 cans broken. Amazon Prime is worth the price less and less lately. At this point, I'm seriously considering waiting the extra couple days to get my things in one piece from a seller who actually cares. Read more | 1.0\nTasty-low-calorie-non-carbonated-pick-me-up.

    "reviews": "The weight watchers chocolate shakes taste is very good. Satisfying. Price was less than I can buy at the grocery store. Easy to grab and go. I haven’t purchased them in the past few months because I found a different brand with higher protein. Which is a priority for me. Read more | 5.0\nI love these.  I’m not always hungry for a meal. It does make you feel full for at least four hours.  Adkins and Premiere taste great but I don’t feel full after drinking them.  I love the taste.  I needed something low carb and some protein. It is convenient too. Read more | 5.0\nThis is my personal experience/opinion, but I truly believe this product helped alleviate my hunger and helped me heal faster. It also came in handy when I had to take my antibiotics. More specifically, when I took my antibiotics on a empty stomach, I was having this bizarre stomach pain; but with this slim fast drink, I didn't feel anything. The taste of this drink is what I expected. Since it has a lot of vitamins and protein, I expected the flavor to be slightly unpleasant and the texture to be a little thick; and I was right. It also has a strong artificial vanilla flavor with artificial sweetener. Overall, the flavor isn't the greatest but it's not bad to the point where I couldn't drink it. In fact, after my 2nd slim fast, I got use to the flavor and started to enjoy it. I'm more grateful that I actually felt satisfied both physically and mentally. I also noticed that the majority of negative reviews are due to expired products. Luckily for me, I didn't have that issue. To end this, if you have any type of oral surgery coming up that will require you to be on a liquid diet, try this first and see if you like it BEFORE YOUR SURGERY. Of course, see if you can get your hand on a single slim fast before you buy this bulk lol Thanks Amazon and Slim Fast 💙 Read more | 5.0\nThey taste great and curve my hunger during the day. I just wish they were a bit larger. Can finish one in no time at all. Read more | 4.0\n5/26/2023: I'm starting a new diet and weight loss plan using Slimfast, healthier meals, and by staying active for at least 30 minutes a day. My starting weight is 185 and I am 5'5\" tall. The goal is to lose 40 pounds. After getting the approval from my doctor, I bought the energy Mocha Cappuccino Slimfast shakes for energy in the morning and I bought regular Slimfast shakes to drink midday. It states on the bottle that in order to lose weight, you can have one meal a day (having at least 1,200 calories a day in total), replace two meals with either shakes smoothies or bars, and you can have up to three snacks. I find this pretty sensible. The shake itself is delicious. There is no chalky taste, either. The cappuccino taste isn't too strong but it's still good. The consistency is thin, not thick like a shake normally would be but this doesn't bother me. I'd say it works so far. I woke up after having a rough nights sleep and this shake gave me the energy boost I needed to start the day and I'm also full as well. We'll see how long the full feeling lasts. If you are trying to lose weight this way, go in to it with the right expectations. I don't think the shake alone is meant to keep you full for hours. It does HELP to keep you full, but you still have to have snacks in between and a decent meal. Will update the review in the future to give results. Good luck to anyone else trying to lose weight! We got this! Read more | 5.0\nThis is now my favorite protein drink!! Flavorful,  no chalky after taste, not super thick, and just the perfect amount for a breakfast or lunch replacement.  Keeps me satisfied and full. Not to mention a great price too!! Read more | 5.0\nThis has helped with my cravings for something sweet and it keeps me full for hours! I used this for a month and was able to lose a little over 10lbs. This is a great food replacement if you are in a hurry or just one something simple and fast. I drank one for breakfast and lunch, then when it comes to dinner I eat something that's not the shake. Read more | 5.0\nChocolate tastes almost like the vanilla. It's drinkable , not super sweet or super chocolatey and filling. However it as a somewhat chalky taste. Protien count and ease of use are what make it 4 stars. More flavor and it would be a 5.

The kicks in relatively quick too, so it's after about 20 - 30 minutes of drinking this expect to start to feel sleepy. At least that's how it works for me. You literally don't have to do anything different with things that you would any other more enhancer. Just put it in a coffee cup full of water, or half a bottle of water, shake it up and drink it. That's it. Also, it tastes delicious. And I don't mean it tastes good for a. supplement kind of good. Let's drink actually really taste delicious in its own right. I often put them in my evening smoothie. If I don't have my smoothie in the morning with my vitamins and stuff in it, I have a tropical smoothie with bananas, pineapples and often mangoes in it in the evening. So this is a great addition to those as well. Read more | 5.0\nI’ve been using this product for months. I love the convenient packets. Easy to travel with.

He will drink 1/2 a bottle before he is ready to head to bed.  We now send them to college for him as no other alternative option seems to work.  He says they don't necessarily make him groggy or overly tired, they just help his brain and body quiet down and settle into a state conducive for sleep.  I have tasted them, and they taste great and are just lightly carbonated.  At times they are hard to find -- I hope they stay on the market as nothing he tries in place of these work as well for him. Read more | 5.0\nThis stuff clearly means everything it says. It definitely has the correct ingredients! I mean within about 30 mins you'll be yawning. It leads to a deep sleep as well and I've been waking up feeling well rested. My only complaint actually is the fact that I did an additional order and the shipper delayed the order for 30 days. Seems like an inventory issue which is very unfortunate Read more | 4.0\nThey give you the perfect amount of energy they truly work I’ve been hooked for 4 yrs sad I can only get them here now. Read more | 5.0\nI used to take this back in the day. It was awesome. I'd literally take it every morning before the chemistry class after not sleeping more than 4 hours the night before, and I'd sit through lectures still half asleep and yet absorb everything. The rush from the caffeine didn't make my body jittery and instead all of that energy went to my head. Unfortunately, things have changed since then. I think this product line went from being called NeuroGasm, to NeuroSupreme, to NeuroPassion, and back to NeuroGasm again. They had the same disappointing description of \"proprietary blend\" (to protect their formula from those that may intend to steal it, but that left consumers wondering of what they bought and whether or not they got their money's worth) as they do now, but they'd have the total weight of the blend listed. Now they only list the dose of the caffeine (100mg) for the product like they do with their NeuroSonic line which also is terrible. Originally, NeuroGasm (or Neuro Passion, also Neuro Supreme) and NeuroSonic used to almost have all the same ingredients, but NeuroGasm just had more as proved by the total weights of the proprietary blends. So NeuroGasm was just a way better product for mental performance (for the same price too) than NeuroSonic. Now they are both terrible. While the full proprietary blend is no longer listed, since they do have the 100mg of caffeine listed and they order ingredients from more to less in a product, we know for sure that everything else listed below (caffeine and) L-theanine are definitely under (100mg) 50mg. Not only that, but this drink has approximately 9mg of crystalline fructose per the entire 14.5 fl oz of the bottle. The ingredients also list sucralose (may be known as Splenda), which is approximately 188 to 588 times sweeter (per gram) than fructose. The drink is almost as sweet as a can of soda, which has 30g of fructose per 12 fl oz can (Neuro bottles are 14.5 fl oz and not as sweet) so this (12 fl oz) can be our baseline estimate. In order to make approximately make NueroGasm almost as sweet as soda they would need something like either 21g more of fructose, or 112mg to 36mg of sucralose. Because of the 50mg of L-theanine we know it's something more like maybe 49mg to 36mg of sucralose. With NeuroGasm not being as sweet as a soda, it's probably on the lower end of that spectrum. The supplements that are listed as less than that sucralose (from greatest to least) in the ingredients are as follows: Alpha GPC, Resveratrol, niacinamide, pyridoxine HCL Thomas cyanocobalamin, and ergocalciferol. The drink has 20mg of niacinamide, which is 100% of your daily value of niacin. Let's take a look at one of those ingredients, Alpha GPC. There's probably somewhere in between 36mg to 21mg of Alpha GPS in this drink. Alpha GPC's usual dosage in supplements is 300mg, which is several times more than what is in this drink. Ultimately it's not surprising that when I finally got to try this drink again that it didn't work at all other than the small 100mg of caffeine and 50mg of L-theanine. The only Neuro drink that is still worth buying is NeuroSleep. At the very least this still tastes pretty good. Read more | 1.0\nThis really helps me on the days I have trouble falling asleep. I drift off much faster, and stay asleep. When I wake up, there is no grogginess. Highly recommend. Read more | 5.0"

It’s a perfect companion for those looking to revitalize their body and mind, whether during a long workday, a challenging workout, or a gaming marathon. One of the standout features of this energy drink is its unique flavor profile. The blend of curuba and elderflower offers a refreshing and slightly sweet taste that’s not overpowering. Unlike some energy drinks that can be too sugary or artificial, this one strikes a nice balance, making it enjoyable to sip on throughout the day. In terms of its energy-boosting properties, Red Bull lives up to its reputation. Each 8.4 fl oz can is packed with essential B-group vitamins (B3, B5, B6, and B12) and 80 mg of caffeine, which is roughly equivalent to a cup of coffee. This combination helps enhance cognitive functions and keep you alert and focused without the jittery feeling that some high-caffeine drinks can cause. The inclusion of taurine, an amino acid that supports cardiovascular health and muscle function, is another plus. It’s reassuring to know that the ingredients used are aimed at providing real benefits, not just a temporary energy spike. Moreover, Red Bull uses real sugar, with a quantity comparable to an equal-sized cup of apple juice, making it a more natural choice compared to other artificially sweetened energy drinks. One thing to note is the safety information: it’s not recommended for children, pregnant or nursing women, and those sensitive to caffeine. This is standard for most energy drinks, but it’s always good to be reminded. The Red Bull Summer Edition Curuba Elderflower is an excellent choice for anyone needing a reliable and tasty energy boost. The unique flavor, combined with its effective ingredients, makes it a standout product in the crowded energy drink market. Whether you’re pushing through a deadline or gearing up for an intense workout, this drink provides a refreshing and invigorating option.

Read more | 4.0\nAs wrestler, I am very concerned with diet, exercise, and getting as much long lasting energy as possible from everything that I eat (yes believe it or not most successful wrestlers do eat. They just know what to eat and when)! Spark is something I live on both in and out of my season! Long lasting energy, no crash, and compared to most energy supplements extremely healthy!! But that's only half the battle. The other half is finding something that tastes good enough that you are actually excited to take it, and spark does just that! Three scoops (which are surprisingly small) of this stuff spread out throughout the day has been enough to get me through grueling tournaments (including my time at the Colorado state tournament) with ease. Personally I mix a scoop of this with a scoop of Accelerade to make the ultimate energy/recovery/rehydration drink I have ever had. And the best part about spark is that it triples as both a preworkout, energy supplement during your workout, or postworkout/rehydration suppliment depending on when you take it. Outside of wrestling, I am a lifter, work at a tire shop, and particpate in many other sports and community service projects. Through it all, Spark is my go to choice for energy when I need it. Not soda, not red bull, not gatoraid, and not other types of quick energy replacement suppliments. Although I am sure these things do work for other people, I have found that Spark is not only the healthiest of these options, but (at least for me) also one of the most effective options as well. Even on those weigh in days for wrestling or just a normal day when no water is available, I love the taste enough to be able to just put the powder straight in my mouth and take it that way. In terms of the actual product, it mixes very well. Minimal clumping even when it might be a little more saturated than normal due to the lack of enough water and it mixes well with other products (such as Accelerade) nicely if you like to do that. Out of the many flavors I prefer the fruit punch the best, however I have tried all the flavors and would not hesitate to buy any of them if the fruit punch was sold out. You do have to rinse your water bottle a few times to get it all out after you drink it but that is pretty typical of any type of supplement or energy drink. If you have never tried Spark before, I know it might look a little pricey, but it is worth the money! I would definitely recommend trying it out! Take it from the wrestler and just an everyday person who has tried just about everything when it comes to energy/rehydration suppliments out there.

I pray to the heavens that this will be produced forever. Read more | 5.0\nBest energy drink ever.  Taste is good and it works!!!! Only energy drink I’ll swear by and I’ve tried many.  May make you have to pee a lot but for sure energy all day Read more | 5.0\nHave you ever been in the horrid predicament of wasting away in an infuriatingly hot and humid environment, doomed to stare into the wasteland pondering every terrible decision you've ever made that could have somehow built a debt of karma so wide and deep that even the Mariana Trench feels for you? Then, as if the lord of the sands himself rose from the dust, your only friend approaches your hovel of despair, the man keeping you from just making a pilgrimage to oblivion approaches you, and hands you a Wild Tiger. The metal can could have been soaking in nitrogen it's so cold. The can is so drenched with moisture it reminds you of the time your out of shape ass went to the gym and had to apologize profusely to everyone since there wasn't enough disinfectant in the world to clean yourself or the equipment. Its past midnight, the time and place to question what this beverage could be is long since passed. You open the can. Nothing could prepare you for what happens next. A symphony of horns deafens you, a tiger roars, the smell of syphoned jet fuel and pure uncut caffeine assaults the nose like a Mike Tyson sucker punch. All sense of pride that you carried is most assuredly gone and it took your sanity with it as you hold the perfect matrimony of godly jubilance and satanic fury in your dust covered gloved hand. Your buddy cracks his and the sensations hit you again. You're simply terrified. The pearly gates stand before you. St. Peter is holding a wild tiger. He's smiling. In sheer terror you look to your friend, your companion, your battle buddy. He is smiling and cheers you. The moment the liquid ambrosia touches his lips you see God atop a bengal tiger appear next to you. You chug and all the worries you carried with you for all the lives you've ever lived instantly fade away. A tiger aspirates from beneath you in a black and orange haze. The night is a blur. Your mind opens completely, the questions of the universe get answered. Of course... everything was just so simple. Your friend grins... RIDE THE TIGER BABY! Read more | 5.0\nThe energy drink that we counted on, less the Arabic labeling. This item shipped quickly, was packed nicely, and tastes as good as I remembered.

Read more | 5.0\nIf you've ever had Smarties candy or Sweet tarts, the flavor is much like that. In my opinion, the \"serve chilled\" instructions are mandatory, as it is far more refreshing cold. It's a small can, but that also means less total sugar, so if you're not a fan of zero-calorie energy drinks this makes for a good compromise with your sugar addiction if you need to cut back. The drink is very acidic, possibly the most acidic drink I've had on a regular basis. I cannot even think about drinking one until I've had something to eat or it will make me feel sick. Nonetheless, when I'm working through the night and sleep has to wait a bit longer, this really does the trick. I could drink 2 of these and still consume less calories than 1 can of Full Throttle, which has been my go-to for almost 10 years until it has become almost impossible to obtain in my area at a fair price. Read more | 4.0\nMy first introduction into this can of heart palpitations was in 2008 during the surge. We had rip-its and sometimes the rare shock-coffee (if they weren't stolen by the higher HQ), Wild Tiger Energy could actually be bought on the local economy. For 5 dollars American you get a flat of 40. They kept us awake and aware in hostile country. It tastes like a harder redbull. Now let us fast forward 15 years later and I decide to purchase a flat. The price inflated and probably more. After all this is the USA - greatest country on Earth but it also inflates much of its prices. So far, it tastes like I remember. I never drink more than one and it helped when I needed to stay awake on the Night Shift. Read more | 5.0"

    "reviews": "Peach Tea Diet Green Tea Sweet Tea Peach Lemon Tea Green Tea Diet Raspberry Tea Diet Peach Tea Diet Lemon Tea Blueberry White Arnold Palmer Rx Energy In our family, there's one drink that practically deserves its own shelf: the AriZona Arnold Palmer Half and Half. My son, who's somewhat of a beverage connoisseur—or at least thinks he is—can't get enough of it. I've honestly lost count of how many packs we've been through. Every time I see that familiar box in the pantry, I know another smiling face will greet me soon.There's something about the blend of iced tea and lemonade that just works—a delicate balance of sweet and tangy that feels like a mini vacation in each sip. I tend to think it’s the kind of drink that satisfies on a hot day and pairs perfectly with pretty much any meal. You know, just last weekend, we were having a barbeque and, come to think of it, the Arnold Palmer was the star of the show. The 16 fl oz cans are the perfect size, not too much and not too little, making them convenient for lunches or on-the-go hydration. Now, while I'm partial to a simple glass of water, I have to admit, every once in a while, I’ll sneak a can. And yeah, I'm secretly just as hooked as he is. If you haven't tried it yet, well, all I can say is you're missing out on a refreshingly consistent delight. So, it’s safe to say we’re continuous buyers thanks to my son, but honestly, I don't mind in the slightest. Read more | 5.0\nI recently picked up the Arizona Arnold Palmer in the 192-fluid ounce jug, and it has quickly become a favorite in our household. This beverage is a fantastic blend of iced tea and lemonade, offering the perfect balance of sweetness and tanginess. The 192-ounce size is ideal for gatherings or for keeping the fridge stocked with a refreshing drink. It’s great for family dinners, parties, or just for enjoying a cold glass on a hot day. The large jug ensures that we always have a generous supply on hand. The flavor is spot on—neither too sweet nor too tart. The combination of iced tea and lemonade is smooth and refreshing, making it an excellent choice for quenching thirst. It’s a well-loved classic that consistently delivers great taste. The jug is easy to pour and the handle is comfortable to grip, making it convenient to serve. The product is also reasonably priced for the quantity and quality, making it a great value for money. Overall, Arizona Arnold Palmer is a top-notch beverage that combines refreshing flavor with great value. The 192-ounce jug is perfect for keeping everyone hydrated and satisfied. Highly recommended for its taste and convenience! Read more | 5.0\nLove Arizona Green Tea and it's a great price.

    "reviews": "I need caffeine to get through the day.  I just do.  Hey, there are worse things.  But like a lot of people these days, I'm trying to eat healthier and no longer want to ingest unhealthy colas or spend mega dollars to buy \"healthier\" bottled or canned alternatives to get a good amount of caffeine in the form of a cold drink.  I looked at and tried other options, but True Lemon Energy is the best overall I've found to date.  The combination of convenience, zero calories, 120mg of caffeine (from green tea), with no artificial flavors or preservatives was just about everything I was looking for (and it's non-GMO).  So is it perfect?  Of course not.  What is?  It's sweetened with Stevia, which to me has a slight aftertaste, but it's still a helluva lot better than other no-calorie, artificial sweeteners out there so I cut it some slack here.  It's also overly sweet to me as I don't have much of a sweet tooth, so I add a couple packets of True Lemon's lemon packets (just pure lemon crystals -- also excellent in tea or plain seltzer as a cheaper and easier alternative to real lemons BTW) to cut the sweetness a bit and it's much better.  They say to add the Energy powder to 16 ounces of water, but I use 26 ounces of filtered water and I find that to work better (and also gets me drinking more water).  The powder isn't the easiest to get to mix thoroughly in cold water -- probably because they don't add any artificial crap to help it do so -- so I bought a 28-ounce Blender Bottle Sportmixer that mixes it perfectly with just a few shakes.  The powder is still doable in a regular cup as long as you add the water first, but I find the Blender Bottle easier and much better at getting all the powder to dissolve completely.  At first I thought these powder tubes were a little pricey at 62 cents per tube when you buy a four pack (24 tubes total) here on Amazon, but given the lack of good alternatives and that True Lemon uses relatively good and healthier ingredients justifies its price to me.  When I think of all the crap I'm no longer putting in my body and the amount of money I'm saving over buying healthy alternatives at the store, I'm really happy with this True Lemon Energy powder.  And my kids like the regular True Lemon powders without the caffeine, and they're so much better than artificial fruit juice mixes and a nice alternative to real fruit juice/boxes with all their calories.  So for all the reasons listed, TL Energy powder gets a high recommendation from me. Read more | 5.0\nI've been using True Lemon Energy packets for several years now.  Everyone always admires my drinks :)  I make Green Tea in place of regular Southern Tea and put 1 packet in my large mason jar with ice.  Then I add blackberries, one orange and lemon slice.  Sometimes, I'll add a fresh mint or basil from my herb garden (southern months).  My favourite ones are Wild Blackberry Pomegranate, Wild Cherry and Raspberry.  In the Summer months I'll switch up and use the more lemon flavours because its so hot out.  So, if you find these packets at a good price drop them in your cart and subscribe!  They can get scarce and expensive and once you get hooked on them it's like soda to wean off of! Read more | 5.0\nWild blackberry pomegranate is delicious and so refreshing.

I also love the little packets, so easy to carry in your pocket or purse and the price is extremely affordable compared to many energy drinks! Read more | 5.0\nIf you want caffeine that will hit fast and hard, these are great. They have a good amount of caffeine in each packet, but not excessive amounts. They will give you a bit of energy without the usual crash. I’ve been a true citrus fan for the last three or four years. That whole time I had been buying them from grocery stores because idk why I didn’t think to look on Amazon. These are roughly half the cost of purchasing in store though. Fantastic value. The flavor is a bit tart and could be off putting for some drinkers. If that’s something that you might not like, only use half of a packet per 16oz. I love that the ingredients are stupid simple and all natural. I also love the fact that there is no aspartame (Phenylketonurics) as these are linked to serious health risks and give me horrible migraines. Read more | 5.0\nShake it! Shake it!

    "reviews": "Aphrodite Edition: Pomegranate Acai Poseidon Edition: Blueberry Guarana Rating: ★★★★★ (5/5) I was recently introduced to Poseidon Energy Drink and I must say, it has been a complete game changer in my daily routine. This isn't just another energy drink. Poseidon offers a unique and healthier twist to conventional energy drinks that are often laden with harmful chemicals. The first thing that grabbed my attention was Poseidon's commitment to using natural ingredients. It's refreshing to see a product in the energy drink market that cares about what consumers are putting into their bodies. I appreciate the fact that I can actually understand all the ingredients on the back of the can! Having tried Poseidon for the first time, I noticed the clean, refreshing taste - it doesn't leave you with that artificial aftertaste that many other energy drinks do. It's clear that there's a real focus on quality with this product. But the real star of the show is the inclusion of L-theanine. This amino acid is known for its ability to promote relaxation without drowsiness, and it definitely lives up to the hype in Poseidon. I was able to get a significant energy boost without the jittery, anxious feeling that I've experienced with other energy drinks in the past. Whether I'm starting my day, needing a mid-afternoon pick-me-up, or gearing up for a workout, Poseidon gives me a steady, balanced energy boost. It's like getting the benefits of a cup of coffee and a without the jitters. I also appreciate the fact that Poseidon doesn't cause a crash after the energy spike. The energy boost is smooth and sustained, which helps me maintain my productivity throughout the day. In conclusion, Poseidon Energy Drink is a superior choice for those seeking a natural, healthy and effective energy boost. It's a fantastic option for anyone who wants to stay energized and focused, without the unwanted side effects of traditional energy drinks. Amazing value for the money.

They have no added sugar and they have caffeine from natural sources (not synthetic caffeine- which I have a theory synthetic caffeine makes people more jittery- I have no proof though). I think they taste great- they taste like juice not as sweet as apple juice though probably because of the added vegetable juice. I can’t imagine many people would find the flavors offensive.

    "reviews": "I’ve tried a lot of energy drink mixes, but Pure Kick Peach Tea stands out! The flavor is spot-on—refreshing, smooth, and not overly sweet, with just the right balance of peach and tea. It dissolves quickly with no chalky residue, making it super easy to mix on the go. The energy boost is clean and long-lasting—no jitters, no crash, just steady focus and alertness. Whether I’m at the gym, working, or just need a mid-day pick-me-up, this drink mix delivers. Plus, it’s a great alternative to sugary canned energy drinks. Highly recommend if you’re looking for a tasty and effective way to stay energized! Read more | 5.0\nI have been looking for a water enhancer that is coffee flavored that can compare to the discontinued java Mio. This one is close enough. The blood orange is nice and sweet citrusy. The caffeine content is not enough to make you jittery, but enough to wake you up a bit. I prefer these when traveling because coffee tends to make me sleepy. It does have a bit of an artificial sweetener aftertaste, however, it isn't too bad. That is saying something for me who seems to taste pine sol with artificial sweeteners. Read more | 5.0\nI bought these multiple times. I like them a lot. The caffeine actually works and the hydrate ones actually work. They taste good and they’re strong so you can get more flavor if you pour one of them into two different bottles. Read more | 5.0\nThe caffeinated ones are the perfect amount of caffeine for a quick pick me up, taste great  not too strong. Worth it and affordable Read more | 4.0\nThese had become part of my daily life now, taste amazing, 1 of these in a 32 oz water bottle, flavor is intense and taste just like the jolly rancher flavor. Will continue buying. Read more | 5.0\nThe company I usually order from  has been out of the sour apple drinks that I drink all the time so I ordered these to have something similar. These are very good however they are an energy drink and I can only drink them in the morning otherwise I stay up all night. So if it wasn’t for the fact that it was an energy drink, I could drink these all the time because they do have a very good flavor. I do have to use the whole package and a little bit more in my 32 ounce stainless steel Tumblr because I do like my drinks strong. One package or half a package would probably be sufficient for most. This is sour apple so it is a little sour, but not super sour,  but it is very good. Read more | 5.0\nDelicious and great value for money. Gives you the energy to keep you active. Read more | 5.0\nI wouldn't call something with only 55mg of sodium a hydration packet. The flavors are super strong too, even in my 32oz bottle. They are also dyed, so the black cherry especially stains my water bottle/straw. I won't get these again. Read more | 3.0\n5.0"

    "reviews": "Wild Cherry Cranberry Cherry Cranberry Blueberry Acai Black Pomegranate Cherry Cranberry & Blackberry I have been using these packets for about six months and have found them to be very useful. It has provided the right amount of caffeine while also tasing delicious. They have been quite helpful for me and have been a good replacement for sodas and additional cups of coffee. The initial taste can be quite strong, but with a big enough water bottle it is diluted enough to taste good. I highly recommend them if you are looking for caffeine packets to mix in with your water. Read more | 5.0\nI love True Citrus, my family was looking for a healthy alternative to gamer drinks and sugary additives and was pleasantly surprised at True Citrus. Many of the flavors are addictive in taste, I love the Cran Cherry energy. It’s so fresh tasting and love the caffeine and vitamin C boost. The regular packs are delicious too to just keep drinking water. Strawberry, Raspberry, Wildberry and lemon lime are very refreshing. The company is great, they exchange flavors so don’t be afraid to try. I love getting my orders all nice and pretty and packaged in bright packaging. Stevia is a great alternative to other sweeteners. It’s great for anyone with a sensitive bladder or prostate. Read more | 5.0\nGreat flavor! Gives the right amount of energy!! Read more | 5.0\nI like most stevia-based sweeteners, but some use a stevia extract that leaves an aftertaste that I find very unpleasant.  Unfortunately, this product contains such an extract.  If you get along well with stevia extracts, this is a very good water flavoring packet.  If not, either avoid it or buy a minimum quantity so you can check it out first. Read more | 4.0\nI like these a lot. The energy It gives you is fast acting but doesn’t give you the jitters. I wish they’d fit more in a box though. I took all of the sticks out of two boxes and put them in a a box that already had them in them. Three packages worth can fit in one box. lol. Not a problem with taste or effectiveness. Just user preference. Read more | 5.0\nOkay, we have been getting all of the regular TrueLemon flavors and we love them. Original Lemonade, Raspberry Lemonade, Strawberry Lemonade, Watermelon Limeade.... all delicious. When I saw this one, I had to try it out, because I love blueberry and acai, and I sometimes will add guarana powder to my TrueLemon because it actually masks the bitter flavor of the guarana quite well . So I figured why not try a new flavor and skip a step in getting my caffeine... This tastes like poison. It is so bitter and off-putting... the smell when you open the packet is very fruity sweet blueberry, but when you mix it with water it just goes so foul. It is like you are taking really bitter prescription pills and didn't swallow before they started to dissolve, but the entire drink is like that. No sweet fruity flavor to save the crazy bitter taste... I can't tell if it is because of the caffeine or the acai flavor that they are using, but it just isn't working for this one. These were also quite expensive compared to others, which I was able to justify to myself because I was so excited about the flavor and the addition of caffeine, I figured it was worth it... Do not buy this flavor. Please don't let this one stop you from trying the other flavors (especially the ones I listed above), as they are delicious! But they really messed this one up somehow. Read more | 1.0\nThe best flavor! Wish it was priced like the others though. Read more | 5.0\nI like the aspartame free, but a lot of the packets are hard inside. Read more | 3.0\n5.0\n4.0\n1.0"

    "reviews": "Original Dripscicle Dream Pop Cherry Limeade Taste great. Read more | 5.0\nThis drink is pretty tasty. I'd say it tastes like a combination of sprite and yellow Gatorade. I don't mind the flavor and it's definitely drinkable, but I'd likely choose a different one next time. The description of the product mentions a splash of coconut water, but there is no coconut water in this product. You can see that on the picture of the ingredients. So, I'll minus a star for the slight false advertising there. It has about the same amount of caffeine as two cups of coffee so nothing crazy in it. Unless you are not used to caffeine at all, this should not give you any jitteriness or anything like that. I'd definitely recommend this for a quick pick me up, especially if you don't like coffee. The electrolytes are good to keep you hydrated some. Read more | 4.0\nThe cherry limeade is delicious! What a great new flavor. Read more | 5.0\nCurrently sipping on one of these with some ice. They definitely do remind me of those bomb-pops I used to get from the Ice Cream man as a kid. Not sure about the strength of the caffeine or the energy that it provides for me, but I will after I finish it, and will update this review. There are a lot of ingredients, but that's to be expected with most energy drinks, so you know what you're getting into when consuming energy drinks. They're clearly not as pure as a simple coffee, or tea, but they should be much stronger and kick in quicker and last longer in my opinion. The taste is good IMO, didn't pay much attention to the calorie count, or how bad it is for you since again, this is an energy drink, and it's not meant to be consumed regularly or in stead of a proper meal. Read more | 4.0\nTo start off with the taste, it was pleasantly surprising and I enjoyed every sip. It has a medium fruity flavor close to orange citrus and some grapefruit which is really smooth but bold at the same time, it rolls off your tongue but still has some spice & kick to it. I have NEVER tried a Prime drink (whoah, surprising I must be 1 in a million), and I think the flavor is really unique and one of the better flavors in any recent sodas or caffeinated drinks I've tried. 5/5 As for the energy, you can feel your heart rate go up so that tells me all I need to know. The caffeine ingredients it's made with are Taurine, Inositol, I-theanine, glucuronolactone, 200mg caffeine, which is HIGH. To compare it, it's more than 3 cups of coffee so I would personally only have this if I skip out on coffee for the day. You can 100% notice it and hey, it lives up to the energy drink name. Serving size is 1 can, really you might want to bring it down to half a can. 10 calories only... \"only\" because it's not counting the caffeine. 300mg electrolytes is also a lot and you SHOULD be active after drinking this and that's what it's made for. It's more comparable to an energy sports drink with that many packed into this can. Energy rating 55555/5 because that's what it does to my heart and body temp. This thoroughly left me impressed and wanting more, the flavor is amazing and high quality, you can tell thought went into it. The energy actually has that boost of energy you get, which I noticed only after 30 minutes or so which is insane. I would drink this in moderation however, the amount of caffeine could be a pro or a con but I maybe see the hype around this drink and can now say, yes it's a real energy drink lol! Read more | 5.0\nI've been drinking energy drinks for about 20 years now, always love to try new ones. My favorite in history was Von Dutch in 2006 made by Rockstar in the background. These are closer to the more typical modern drinks that are zero sugar, sweetened with sucralose. Something like Gamer Fuel, Bang, or Reign. However, unlike those, These Prime drinks are NOT cloyingly sweet. They are not overwhelming, and they taste refreshing with just enough tang to them. I like a sour drink, I don't tend to prefer the newer style drinks. However these are the best I've had in that category. The value seems to be better than the other brands too for a case, though I have not watched them long enough to see how the price may fluctuate. These are 200mg caffeine, so slightly above the 160mg standard but well below the crazy 300's. I like all of the ingredients. They even have potassium and magnesium! The electrolytes add to the smoothness in their drinkability, slightly like monster which uses mostly standard salt for that. Probably my favorite thing about these is that they don't go crazy on the B vitamins. They have a reasonable 150%  of 6 and 12. The Dripsicle flavor is spot on for the \"freedom pop\" flavor. It tastes like a less sweet slightly tart cherry blue raspberry Sprite if that were a thing. I look forward to trying other Prime flavors now that they are very much on my map. Read more | 5.0\nI am not a big Prime energy drink user, but I like energy drinks especially to build up to an afternoon workout. The sucralose fake sugar flavor is present and OK. It tastes a bit like fake sweetener, but unless you want a sugar calorie injection it is almost impossible to find a tolerable energy drink without fake sugar so I do not ding this drink for its sucralose (and maybe one other fake sweetener?). The flavor of cherry limeade--now, I do not know how they landed on this formulation. To me this tastes almost nothing like cherry limeade. Maybe I would believe it is key lime pie. There is some fake spice flavor like a cinnamon or nutmeg that comes through. It is strange and I feel like I have to turn off my brain to drink this. I would try another flavor next time. My husband disagreed with me about the flavor. He felt that he could taste both the cherry and the lime but that the drink had a mouthfeel that was quite thick and syrup-y and that was the only thing that he felt was strange. Read more | 4.0\nThis flavor ain’t it. I’m typically a fan of cherry lime but this ain’t it. Bad after tastes almost leaves your tongue feeling like you ate too much sugary candy Read more | 1.0"

    "reviews": "Tangerine Pineapple Mango Lemon Lime Dragon Fruit Variety I was an avid energy drink person to avoid ~other substances~ when going out with friends OR using crazy pre-workout when exercising. The ingredients in other energy drinks are plain scary and ones I'm trying to avoid at all costs. With that, the sugar content is ABSURD so I needed to find a good replacement. I saw these in an article for organic energy drinks and had to try it out. They sadly don't sell single cans anywhere near me, so I ordered on Amazon. It's relatively the same price buying through Nooma with their subscription so couldn't hurt. I was really impressed! No the taste is not always very delicious (the lime flavor was definitely the worst, weird medicine taste but I got through it), it isn't overly sugary, great ingredients, lions mane and ashwagandha to keep you sane. All in all a great product to use as pre-workout, drink before a night out OR to just get you through the day. I'm pretty caffeine sensitive so I have to be careful with these drinks, they're so easy to drink half and stay up all night! I usually drink about a 1/3 of the drink and it definitely wakes me up and gets me through whatever I need to get through. No itchiness, no weird caffeine symptoms. 10/10 Read more | 5.0\nI am sure the energy part is fine but you can't get more than 2 sips in before you make an ugly face and place it down. It tastes so ao bad. If you like sparkling water you'll probably be fine. It tastes like metallic water with the smallest hint of fruit. 0/10. Big regrets. Read more | 1.0\nI have bought my 5th or 6th case now and have had 0 issues. For years ive been looking for healthy energy drinks and have come accross a few that claim to but they always have atleast 1 trash ingredient. NOOMA gets a 10/10 for me. 120mg may seem low with everything upwards of 300mg theese days but i feel more awake and aware with theese. Not super sweet or artificial but crisp and refreshing i love all the flovors especially dragonfruit. Love the product i will be a continued customer. Read more | 5.0\nIf you want a clean no jung drink, this is the one. I know that many naturals and clean physicians are recommend it. It does have more natural flavor which taste weird at beginning but I got use after 2-3 days and I really like it now.  No synthetic stuff like sugar and other bad things. So get ready for some natural taste! 👍👍 Read more | 4.0\nGreat product just wasn’t satisfied with the flavors. But I’m always looking for clean products and this checked the boxes for that! Read more | 3.0\nEarly morning workouts are so much better with a NOOMA Energy Drink. Coffee is not a good option for me at 5 AM and this 120mg Caffeine drink by NOOMA is perfect! It brings my alertness right up and does not cause me to have the jitters or upset stomach. After lunch, if I need a pick me up, I will drink one or even half a can and save the rest for the next day. Wearing a mask has further decreased my electrolytes and my chiropractor said to increase them, NOOMA fits the bill perfectly. Real ingredients in each can do not leave a horrible after taste. I like all the flavors, but Dragon Fruit is my most favorite.  Highly recommend! Read more | 5.0\nI have been using NOOMA now for a few weeks and like their drinks. My first order came in without issue, however my latest order came in with opened/damaged cans and what looked like mold/dirt. I ended up have to toss the order because cans were either open, damaged, or covered in mold/dirt. There doesn’t appear to be a policy for getting replacement items. Good drink, unfortunate packing/delivery. Read more | 1.0\nThis is the healthiest energy drink out there. The taste is not great, this is why it's the healthiest. Most things that are good for you don't taste good. Read more | 2.0"

    "reviews": "Watermelon Limeade Watermelon Raspberry Lemonade Rainbow Sherbet Pineapple Raspberry Medley Orange Pineapple Melon Punch Fruit Punch Cherry Pomegranate Blue Raspberry Strawberry Pina Colada I use this almost everyday. This is my favorite flavor and it I get it way faster from Amazon than the manufacturer. I put it in a little warm water to dissolve it well. Then fill up my cup with ice. My kids say it dissolves fine in a bottle of water shaken also. It is not chalky or gritty so it is very drinkable.  It gives me the same if not more of a pick me up as coffee does. The quality is the same as buying from GFuel. Read more | 5.0\nThe G Fuel Fruit Punch Tub is a fantastic choice for anyone looking to boost their energy and endurance with a delicious and effective supplement. With 40 servings packed into a 9.8 oz tub, this formula delivers impressive performance and great value. The fruit punch flavor is a standout. It's vibrant and refreshing, offering a fruity burst that makes every sip enjoyable. The taste is well-balanced, not too sweet or overpowering, making it easy to drink even during intense workouts or long gaming sessions. In terms of performance, G Fuel Fruit Punch does not disappoint. The energy boost is both sustained and smooth, helping you stay alert and focused without the jitters or crashes often associated with other energy products. The formula supports endurance and mental clarity, making it perfect for both physical activities and cognitive tasks. The powder mixes easily with water, dissolving completely without any clumps or residue. This ensures a smooth, pleasant drinking experience every time. The tub’s design is convenient and user-friendly, with a secure lid and an included scoop for precise servings. One of the best aspects of G Fuel is the range of benefits it offers without relying on artificial ingredients. The formula is crafted to provide clean energy and enhanced performance, making it a great option for health-conscious individuals looking for an effective energy boost. Overall, the G Fuel Fruit Punch Tub is an excellent choice for anyone seeking a tasty and reliable energy supplement. Its delightful flavor, effective formula, and convenient packaging make it a top pick for enhancing your energy levels and endurance. Highly recommended for its great taste and powerful performance! Read more | 5.0\nI recently tried the G Fuel Hype Sauce Energy Drink Powder, and while the flavor is great—fruity and refreshing with a nice tang—I wasn’t a fan of how powdery it feels. No matter how much I shook or stirred, I couldn’t fully get rid of that gritty texture. It’s almost like there’s always a little excess powder floating around, which made it less enjoyable to drink. That said, it does give a nice energy boost, and the taste is on point. If you don’t mind a bit of powderiness at the bottom of the cup or like mixing it into a smoothie to mask the texture, it’s still a solid energy drink. Overall, G Fuel Hype Sauce has great flavor and energy-boosting power, but if you’re picky about the texture, you might find it a bit too powdery. Read more | 4.0\nI've been a fan of G Fuel for a long time, ever since I discovered their amazing flavors and formulas that give me the boost I need to dominate in my favorite games. Whether it's Call of Duty, Fortnite, or Among Us, G Fuel always helps me stay focused, alert, and energized. Plus, it's sugar-free, gluten-free, keto-friendly, and packed with antioxidants and vitamins. What more could you ask for? But when I heard about their latest flavor, Hype Sauce, I was intrigued. Raspberry lemonade? That sounds delicious! And the packaging is so cool: it features the trippy illustrations of Brooklyn-based artist Mike Perry, who collaborated with G Fuel to create this exclusive flavor. The tub is bright pink and yellow, with a funky design that screams \"HYPE\". I couldn't wait to try it out. So I ordered a tub from their website (which was super easy and fast), and it arrived in a few days. I opened it up and smelled the powder: wow! It smelled like fresh raspberries and lemons, with a hint of sweetness. It made my mouth water instantly. I scooped one serving (7 grams) into 16 ounces of water and shook it well. The powder dissolved quickly and turned the water into a vibrant pink color. I took a sip and... OMG! It was amazing! It tasted exactly like raspberry lemonade, but better. It was refreshing, tangy, sweet, and smooth. It had no artificial aftertaste or chalkiness. It was like drinking liquid candy, but without the guilt. It was so good that I finished the whole bottle in minutes. But how did it make me feel? Well, let me tell you: it made me feel awesome! Within 10 minutes of drinking it, I felt a surge of energy and focus that lasted for hours. I felt more alert, more creative, more motivated, and more confident. Hype Sauce definitely lived up to its name: it hyped me up like nothing else. It also improved my mood and boosted my immunity, which is always a plus in these crazy times. And best of all: it had zero sugar and only 15 calories per serving. How awesome is that? So what's my verdict? Well, if you haven't guessed by now: I love Hype Sauce! It's one of my favorite flavors from G Fuel ever (and trust me, I've tried them all). It's delicious, refreshing, energizing, and mood-enhancing. It's perfect for gamers who want to level up their performance and have fun at the same time. It's also great for anyone who needs a pick-me-up during the day or night. Read more | 5.0\nI like G Fuel as a brand. I know that excessive amounts of B vitamins aren't great for my health long term. However, caffeine consumption is an almost unavoidable habit for most of us. Cans of G Fuel have long been a favorite drink of mine, and the cost of buying the powder (especially if you can get it on sale!) makes this habit so much more affordable. After a slight trial and error testing of the amount of powder needed in a scoop for my drink shaker, and an adjustment period of that EVER SO SLIGHT powder taste. I will say that this has been a very nice investment that allows me to have to make those late-night QT runs or spend more money on the cans in the long run. My advice is to buy a few different flavors you like so you can mix up drinks, that way you don't get burnt out on the same consistent flavor.

    "reviews": "Just the right energy boost when I need it the most. Very delicious, excellent quality. Makes me feel good and energized. Read more | 5.0\nThis was a great tasting drink and doesn’t have an aftertaste like other sparkling waters (which I don’t like). It has a good sparkling fruit flavour. The drink is smooth going down and it is very refreshing and it keeps you awake all day while only being 70mg of caffeine. This goes to show you that you don’t have to have a high caffeine content like 200mg. You will stay alert, calm and you stay focused even when watching a movie without feeling tired later as some energy drinks make you feel. As an added bonus, I like that this drink specifically is made with real fruit juice so you know it’s healthier and with vitamins added too. Some drinks say 0% juice. You know this is good when you have three left. I will definitely be buying this again. Read more | 5.0\nSeriously, I can't get enough of this stuff. The flavor is so good—like a refreshing burst of berry magic that actually tastes natural and not like some weird artificial concoction. And the best part? No jitters or weird crashes because the caffeine isnt too high but everything was high enough to help my mind in work. It gives me all the energy and focus I need to power through my day without feeling like I'm bouncing off the walls. If you’re looking for an energy drink that’s smooth and delicious without the downside, Alpine Bliss is where it’s at. Trust me, you need this in your life. Read more | 5.0\nThe taste is good, but it offers no energy. It is too expensive to not work. I would not buy again. Read more | 1.0\nDon't typically drink drinks that contain real fruit juice, but this beverage was fairly low calorie/carb AND used high quality juices (like strawberry juice), so I decided to give it a try. Have been looking for additional energy drink options that are healthier and more effective (better focus without a crash) - this drink covered those boxes! I felt like this gave me more focus without giving me a \"jolt\" or crash. I didn't feel like this majorly affected my blood sugar levels either. I also really liked the taste; it was fruity and tart but not foul/artificial. Witih only 70mg of caffeine, this would be a better midday drink option so it doesn't interfere as much with bedtime. If you're looking for a redbull alternative, this is a great option! Read more | 5.0\nI'm extremely happy with Alpine The wild berries flavor is spot-on, everything on this drink is good for someone like me who’s always on the go and daily, as an Active duty member I enjoy this energy drink on my daily! Perfect for workouts, studying, or daily productivity, just pure energy. Some of my favorite things about it - Unique flavor - Rapid, sustained energy - Natural ingredients - No crash or jitters Highly Recommended! Read more | 5.0\nI bought this product for energy in which it did everything it said it would do. Great taste, energy, and cognitive thinking. I love that it had 5 grams of sugar and barely any calories gave me energy and no crash and had a great berry flavor. I would recommend to anyone who likes energy drinks they are a little pricey. If you are looking for energy without the calories and the sugar this drinks for you!!! Read more | 4.0\nI purchased these Alpine Bliss Drinks as a new alternative to my other caffeine products and they didn’t disappoint! They’re a perfect convenient size being only 8.4 oz but they have 70mg of caffeine, a great pick me up, I actually felt great the rest of the day after drinking! Price wise they’re super great being only about $3 per can so I don’t feel guilty buying them. They’re surprisingly sweet considering they only have about 5g of sugar but have a great berry flavor with no weird aftertaste & the ingredients look great to me. I’d definitely recommend these and will likely continue to purchase them! Read more | 5.0"

    "reviews": "Strawberry Peach Pineapple Passionfruit Blackberry Lemonade Variety As a Rock climber that tried countless energy drinks, KENETIK is on a whole different level. Unlike traditional caffeine-based options, this ketone-powered formula delivers clean, sustained energy without the jitters or inevitable crash. It’s the perfect solution for staying sharp and focused throughout the day, whether I’m grinding through work, rock climbing, or needing a mental boost. What I love: -No caffeine, no sugar – No sudden energy spikes or crashes, just smooth, sustained fuel. -Amazing focus & mental clarity – The Ketone benefits are real! I feel sharper and more productive. -Great taste & variety – The flavors are refreshing and enjoyable without being overly sweet. Read more | 5.0\nI recently purchased the Kenetik ketone drink variety pack in cans from Amazon, and I was pleasantly surprised. I've been exploring the potential benefits of ketones for a while, and Kenetik seemed like a reputable brand. The cans are convenient and easy to take on the go, making it easy to incorporate into my daily routine. The flavors were surprisingly enjoyable. I tried the variety pack which included Blackberry Lemonade, Strawberry Peach, and Pineapple Passion Fruit. All three were pretty good and can be a bit sour until you get used to it - that’s the ketones. I noticed a noticeable boost in energy about 30 minutes after drinking it. I also felt more focused and less jittery than I sometimes get with caffeine. The effects lasted for a while, which was great. Overall, I'm very happy with my purchase of the Kenetik ketone drink variety pack in cans. The convenience, taste, and energy-boosting effects make it a great option for anyone looking to try ketones. Read more | 5.0\nLove this drink. I Have been drinking daily for a few months now. I feel a difference when I forget to drink one. Do not notice a change in energy per day, but more on mental clarity. I do wish the supply chain would get figured out though. Sometimes my order comes late because it is sold out! my BIGGEST complaint is the packaging. On 3 separate orders I’ve had leaking cans in the case. Leaving a rancid smell, almost like the smell of when you used to return cans in the back of the grocery store way back In the day!  If you know, you know!!! Read more | 5.0\nMy wife and I wanted to try the drink from watching roman Atwood. We tried all 3 flavors and by far prefer the pineapple.  As for effectiveness it's okay doesn't pack a punch like others. First drink of it slightly sour but you can tell it's all natural. Now as you can see Celsius a energy drink I drink often has less calories, less sodium and more vitamins at a cost of $2.50 compared to 5 dollars. Also of you have acid reflux, or get heart burn easy stay away from kenetik it will cause it to flair up. All in all it's a good quality product, im glad I tried it, as for the value for the money all natural yes, would I spend 5$ a can on it probably not again.  The product is good but I think it needs some tweaks on it still. Like sodium levels and acid levels in it Read more | 3.0\nHaving a hard time deciding between this flavor and the pineapple passionfruit one as the best. Gives you good energy. Only 60 calories per can. A little more pricey but if your able to swing it give it a try. Worth it!! So yummy!!! Read more | 5.0\nLove this. It is a little sour but I cant get enough of it! Read more | 5.0\nThe flavors pop in your mouth honestly would’ve gave it a five star, but I’m not a big sparkling water fan. I like that it’s different from a normal energy drink. It definitely lasts a lot longer and there’s no crash. Read more | 4.0\nI have tried many energy drinks over the years. Most give you energy and you eventually crash. This stuff is Amazing!! The clarity in my mind is next level. The fog from years of contact sports is lifted when I drink this! Not sure what a ketone is but I want more! I like to liken it to the Movie Limitless. The energy is something that isn't strong or overpowering. No jitters or shakes like many other energy drinks. It feels natural. No Crash Just the ability to focus and feel awake. No more afternoon Blues! Thanks to Roman and the KENETIK team for helping me find myself again! Read more | 5.0"

    "reviews": "Sour Apple Watermelon Strawberry Lemonade Pomegranate Mango Peach Grape Berry The only energy drink that actually works. Read more | 5.0\nI've ordered these from this seller before, but delivered by private couriers and the bottles and box were pretty beat up. These delivered by Amazon are perfect! I like these energy drinks and compare them to a 5 hr Energy. I feel like all energy shots work better for me to take 1/2 of an extra strength if available vs a whole regular strength. These are the same for me in that respect. Both these and 5 hr do tend to give me jittery energy with an inevitable crash, but the shots that don't do that to me are over $3 each. Bang for your buck can't be beat. If you like 5 hr Energy shots, you should try these, it's hard to justify their price though if these work for you. I have no idea what \"warmth\" is in reference to this product. It does not give me the sweats quite as badly as a 5 hr, but both do a little. I suppose I like the flavor, but the flavor of an energy shot is simply not something I care about at all... perhaps b'c I think they all taste equally gross and I am grateful there is only an ounce. That said, to this is a pretty good flavor. It's pretty sour, but you can almost taste or maybe smell something mango or peach like. Read more | 5.0\nIt gives me a little more energy - Sometimes.  I don’t take it religiously, maybe if I did, I’d be able to give a proper review. Read more | 4.0\nFound this at my local gas station intrigued by the name I tried it out. Took one shot and ended up doing a DEEP clean of my car that I’ve been meaning to do. Super focused, sustained energy and I’m a caffeine junky so I immediately went online to buy the box. (I also noticed “down there” had more “energy” thanks to the added yohimbine) worth the money very cheap Read more | 5.0\nIntact, seals not broken. Read more | 5.0\nI want to start off by saying that I was really excited for this. I love sour apple candy, and I am trying to find the best energy shots I can (I prefer them over pre-workout). I'll list my findings below. Taste: hardly any, certainly not sour. It kind of tastes like watered down apple powder. Mostly water. 60% water, 30% apple, 10% citric acid. And again, not sour—even with the citric acid. Effect: None. Supposedly there's two servings of 172 mg of caffeine in this bottle, but I drank half of the bottle and felt literally nothing. My normal energy shots have anywhere between 150 and 220 mg of caffeine, and I usually have to pace myself through one of those. With this, I felt literally nothing. I waited a half an hour, nothing. **Edit: I drank an entire shot and felt the TINIEST bit of the caffeine. Value for money: If this product worked, it would be a fantastic value for money. You get quite a bit for not very much. I was pretty disappointed with this, and I really wish that weren't the case. I wanted this to be good: I really enjoy a good energy shot, and I love Sour Apple. No idea how this got the rating it got, but I'm glad somebody else enjoys it. If you do, keep supporting them, please. Check out the Daily Power energy shot in blue raspberry, those are good and are like a punch in the face. I just wanted to try something new. Read more | 1.0\nI've been using these for sometime, and they get the job done as far as giving you an energy boost.  However they were poorly packaged by someone who could obviously care less about what they're doing or the customer.  The boxes the dozen bottles come in were beaten to a degree where it looks like someone ran over them with a car.  They were also stained all over by an unknown liquid (although it was not from the bottles themselves, each being  intact).  I highly recommend the product, but you're taking your chances on receiving them undamaged. Read more | 3.0\nThe flavor is OK but not my favorite. Read more | 5.0"
